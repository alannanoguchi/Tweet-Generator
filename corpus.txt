MEREDITH (VOIX OFF): In our own way, we shed our skin. Biologically, we're brand-new people.
WOMAN: Are you visiting Seattle for the first time?
MIRANDA: Oh, no, no. I live in Seattle. I- I just went home for a month. I took my son to see my parents.
WOMAN: Oh. What do you do in Seattle?
MIRANDA: Uh, I'm a surgeon.
WOMAN: Uh, uh, did you know any of those doctors... (lowered voice) from that shooting?
MERDEDITH (VOIX OFF): We may look the same. We probably do. The change isn't visible… At least not in most of us. But we're all changed… Completely… Forever.
MEREDITH: But that's normal. I mean, it's a biological imperative-- change. So the shooting changed me. I'm changed. But I'm also ready to get back to work. I mean, as ready as any of us are. But I'm also ready sitting around the house, waiting... I just spend my time worrying.
DR PERKINS: Your husband was shot. That's a lot to worry about.
MEREDITH: I'm worried about Cristina. She's getting married, and that's just... Well, I had to cut her out of her last wedding dress with scissors, so...
DR PERKINS: You watched your husband gets shot.
MEREDITH: He's fine. He's coming back to work today, actually. (screams inaudibly)(shell casing clatters) (monitor emitting continuous tone) We're all fine. (monitor alarm blares) (pager beeps) Uh, ex-excuse me.
DR PERKINS: Is everything okay, Dr. Grey?
MEREDITH: Yes. Yes. Everything's fine.
(cell door clatters) (bangs)
MAN: Opening two. (buzzer sounds)
DEREK: It doesn't look too bad. You just gotta keep an eye on it. Make sure it doesn't get any bigger. But if it changes color, you should see a doctor.
MAN: Dr. Shepherd.
DEREK: Mm.
PRISONER: Your lady looks pissed. (buzzer sounds)
MEREDITH: Again, Derek? (cell door clangs)
ARIZONA: Whew. (sighs) (elevator bell dings) What?
CALLIE: Nothin'. Just… You're awesome.
MIRANDA: Chief.
RICHARD: Oh, Dr. Bailey. Welcome back.
MIRANDA: Thank you, sir.
RICHARD: We missed you here. The place isn't the… same. Mm. Uh, did you get cleared for surgery?
MIRANDA: What do you mean, "cleared for surgery"? Who has to clear me?
(elevator bell dings)
MEREDITH: Well, the next time, I'll leave you there.
DEREK: You said that already.
MEREDITH: Oh, Derek got arrested again.
DEREK: Meredith…
MEREDITH: Reckless endangerment.
DEREK: Please.
CRISTINA: Did he lose his license yet?
MEREDITH: Oh, no, because they don't charge him, because the cops worship him.
DEREK: Because I saved some of their lives.
MEREDITH: What are we picking?
CRISTINA: Dress color. I'm not wearing white. Mm. It's sexist and… vaguely racist. Oh. No white, no veil, no rice.
MEREDITH: Well, what will your mother say?
CRISTINA: No mother.
MEREDITH: (sighs) you know, I didn't get cleared for surgery… and I'm pretty sure it's your fault.
DEREK: Meredith, I am the chief. I can overrule the counselor.
MEREDITH: You can? (chuckles) Yes. I love the blue.
APRIL: Chief shepherd, you're back.
DEREK: Good morning.
APRIL: I find a giant skull base chordoma. Biggest one I've ever seen.
DEREK: Really?
APRIL: He came in to the e.R. With trouble breathing.
MEREDITH: You got cleared for surgery?
APRIL: I did.
MEREDITH: Bitch.
CRISTINA: I like the brown, too.
APRIL: I know it looks inoperable. I mean, I would've said it was inoperable, but you're back and you're you.
DEREK: Right. Hey, uh, yes, good morning. Thank you. Thank you very much. (staff cheers) Good. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's, uh, it's great to be back. First of all, I'd like to thank Dr. Webber for stepping up in my absence. Thank you. (staff cheers) Uh, I'm grateful for all of you, for all of your support during my recovery. Thank you. Uh, it's just, uh, so great to be back as chief. I'm grateful for the, uh… (inhales sharply) I'm sorry. That's a lie. That's what people say, and, uh, the truth is… (man clears throat) I hate being chief. I hate it. (staff murmuring) Chief Webber… (murmuring continues) Chief Webber is our chief. Um… And I'm sorry, but this giant… Sorry, I gotta go look at this chordoma. I, um, I'm sorry, but… (chuckles) I quit. (staff murmuring) Let's go, Kepner. Come on.
APRIL: Oh, sorry. Okay.
MIRANDA: (laughing) He just quit. (continues laughing)
MEREDITH: He was supposed to clear me for surgery.
ALEX: (exhales) Yeah.
TEDDY: The bullet's at the surface. That's good. I can take it out now.
ALEX: Nah. I mean, if it's not infected, I’m gonna keep it. It's my war wound. (chuckles) Besides… Chicks dig that crap.
(door opens) (beeps)
CALLIE: (sighs) Oh, my god.
MARK: Wow. You weren't kidding.
APRIL: The last surgeon broke the dura, which enabled the tumor to mushroom into the brain and down into the spine. DEREK: It's wrapped around his brain stem. (beep) whatever we do, we need to do it quickly.
MARK: The size of this thing... Normally I open up the sinuses or the hard palate.
DEREK: Well, now you have to open up both.
MARK: You want me to split his whole face open? Sinuses, hard palate, tongue, jaw…
CALLIE: A broken jaw is excruciating, let alone the rest of it.
MEREDITH: Does this kid know what he's in for?
DEREK: He wants to live. I don't think he's concerned about the pain.
MEREDITH: Well, but you don't know how enmeshed the tumor is. You don't even know if you can get it all.
DEREK: Thank you, Dr. Grey.
MARK: If you want to try this thing, Torres and I are gonna need to coordinate. What are we thinking, a week?
DEREK: No later.
CALLIE: I'll clear my schedule. Welcome back, Dr. Shepherd.
DEREK: Thank you, Dr. Torres.
MEREDITH: You're not even cleared for surgery yet. (monitor beeps)
DEREK: I'll get cleared. (clears throat)
(Reflection eternal feat. Estelle) (record needle scratches, music stops)
RICHARD: Uh, Dr. Grey.
MEREDITH: (chuckles) Chief Webber.
RICHARD: Yeah, a little… little exercise.
MEREDITH: Okay.
RICHARD: Mm. Something I can do for you?
MEREDITH: Yeah. Um, that stupid counselor Perkins, he won't clear me for surgery. So I was just wondering…
RICHARD: No.
MEREDITH: But he cleared…
RICHARD: I'm… I'm sorry. I am. But we brought in the best, and when Andrew Perkins says you're not cleared, then it's him you need to talk to.
LEXIE: Did you hear that Dr. Yang and Dr. Hunt are getting married?
DR PERKINS: I did.
LEXIE: It's pretty great, huh? It's almost like a silver lining. You know, I… I've read a lot about trauma and how, uh, sometimes people just up and change their lives. They say that the trauma was the best thing that could've happened to them. You know, like Dr. Shepherd this morning. Did you hear that he's not chief anymore?
DR PERKINS: And how have you been, Dr. Grey? You've been through a lot since I last saw you.
(gunshot) (flashback)
ANDREW: does, uh, anyone have anything to say? I know that, uh, a lot of you are only here because this has been mandated. So let's talk. Anything at all?
CRISTINA: I ate a really good taco from one of those trucks by the side of the road.
MEREDITH: When?
CRISTINA: Last night. You were asleep.
JACKSON: Which truck? The one on 7th?
ALEX: I want to I like tacos.
APRIL: Me, too.
LEXIE: I read a book… About the history of mass murders in the US. That's… that's the actual name of what happened to us. It was a mass murder. You can't call it a terrorist attack, because the murders weren't political in nature. And we weren't the victims of a serial killer, because Mr. Clark would've had to murder several people over a period longer than 30 days in order to qualify him as a serial killer. We could call it a spree killing... (gunfire) which is defined as killings at two or more locations with no break or pause in between, because Mr. Clark shot that guy in his car before he got here. But I'm not sure that… that counts as a true second location since it was so close to the hospital, which means that we were a mass murder, because it happened at one place, by one person, and more than four people were killed.
(object rattles) (taps fingers on table)
OWEN: Oh, that was quite a show this morning.
DEREK: I didn't plan it.
OWEN: (chuckles) Made it better. Any regrets?
DEREK: No. Any regrets about proposing to Cristina?
OWEN: None.
DEREK: Getting shot turns out to not be the worst thing after all.
OWEN: I need a best man. I… I know… I know we're not that close, but… I don't know. You being married to the other twisted sister, I… (chuckles) I just thought it… It kinda made us like brothers or something.
DEREK: I'd be honored. It's an honor.
OWEN: Thank you.
DEREK: You need a bachelor party?
OWEN: No, no, no.
DEREK: Even better.
(elevator bell dings)
(siren wailing)
DR PERKINS: On the, uh, day of the shooting, I understand that you had a particularly difficult day.
MIRANDA: On the day I gave birth to my son, and he needed a craniotomy, and he almost died on Derek Shepherd's table. Now that was a particularly difficult day. And at the end of that day, my son was born, and my husband lived. But at the end of this day… The, uh… ‘Unh! (shell casing clatters) No! No!’ Um... This daywas the worst dayof my life.
(flashback)
BEN: Miranda. (she gasps) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…
MIRANDA: No, you… you don't just sneak up on people. Okay?
BEN: You don't… I got these. I was, um, I was playing golf. My phone was off, and I'm...
MIRANDA: You know, 18 people got shot, 11 died, one in my arms. A boy died in my arms, and you were playing golf.
BEN: Bailey…
MIRANDA: We gotta go. (Tuck babbles)
BEN: Well, where… where are you going?
MIRANDA: Home, uh, to my mom. Right? Yeah? We're gonna go see grandma? Yeah, Tuck. Here you go.
BEN: When are you coming back?
MIRANDA: Okay, here, here. Here's your car.
BEN: Miranda, w… when are you coming back?
MIRANDA: (engine turns over) Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, tuck.
DONNA (PATIENT’S MOTHER): No. No.
GREG (PATIENT): M… mom.
DONNA: You're talking about slicing his face in half, breaking his jaw, cutting his tongue. It's just… it just sounds crazy.
DEREK: I know. I wish I could offer some comfort, but honestly, there's no comfort that can be offered in this situation. Let me just say that... Every medical advancement started with the statement, "that sounds crazy." Let me try. Donna, let me help.
DONNA: Okay. Let's try. Let's... Okay.
DEREK: Good. Okay.
MEREDITH: He could not wake up. He could… wake up… and never be able to move again. He could go blind. He could lose his ability to speak or to eat. He could require around-the-clock care for the rest of his life. He could be in a tremendous amount of pain for the rest of his life. He could die on the table. If that doesn't happen, if none of those things happen, he's still facing months of excruciatingly painful recovery from this surgery. And before you make a decision, you need to understand the risks. You're driving awfully fast, Dr. Shepherd. The least you could do is wear a seat belt.
DR PERKINS: You've been working.
ALEX: In the clinic, in the pit. We haven't been allowed to operate, which makes zero sense if you ask me.
DR PERKINS: I'd like to, uh, talk to you about the incident last week.
ALEX: She's not my responsibility.
DR PERKINS: She was your girlfriend.
ALEX: Well, she's not anymore.
(monitor beeping rhythmically) (flashback)
MARK: Karev, give me another suture.
LEXIE: My patient didn't bring her meds. She doesn't even know their names. I… if I give her albuterol and she's on propanolol, then she'll stop breathing. If… if I give her warfarin and she's on ibuprofen, then she'll… then she'll bleed out. If I give her diphenhydramine and she's on doxepin, then she'll die. So do… do… do you think she wants to die?
MARK’S PATIENT: Is she kidding?
MARK: Karev, what's going on over there?
LEXIE: I think that she wants to die. I think she wants me to kill her. Do… do you… do you… do you want me to kill you? Because you… you could just get a gun, and it would be a lot faster.
MARK: Karev, get her outta here.
LEXIE: You know what? So why doesn't somebody find a gun... (clattering) And we'll bring her a gun and just shoot her...
MARK: Karev, help her. I can't step away. Get her out of here!
LEXIE: 'cause she obviously wants to die Help! Somebody find her a gun 'cause she wants to die!
ALEX: I got my own stuff to do.
LEXIE: Somebody find something!
DR PERKINS: Why did you walk away?
ALEX: Look, life is too short. I almost died trying to stop that guy. Besides, I mean... You know how much tail you get offered when you're carrying a bullet around in your chest? It's like I'm a legend.
DR PERKINS: Are you, uh... always this crass, or is that a defense mechanism? I've had too much crazy for one lifetime.
MARK: You cleared Lexie Grey for surgery?
DR PERKINS: Dr. Sloan, I'm in… I'm in session.
MARK: I had to check her into psych last week. I had to commit her against her will! And you just clear her for surgery? What the hell kind of doctor are you?
LEXIE: It's okay. You can talk to him.
ALEX: I'll come back.
MARK: Yeah, walk away. You're good at that.
DR PERKINS: She got snowed. Psych put her on heavy doses of antipsychotics and benzos. And then she slept for almost 50 hours straight. When she woke up, she was no longer a risk to herself or others. I mean, she has P.T.S.D. Most of you do. For her, it caused severe sleep deprivation and led to a breakdown. All she needed was sleep. So protocol is that she goes back to work.
LEXIE: See? I'm okay. Really. I'm back.
TEDDY: Clamp.
OWEN: So how are you? I hear there's a guy.
TEDDY: Yeah, there's a guy.
OWEN: Mm. That good? (laughs)
TEDDY: (laughs) Shut up. I need another clamp. So… You're getting married.
OWEN: I am. I am getting married.
TEDDY: I'm happy for you. I am, really.
OWEN: Really?
TEDDY: Yeah.
OWEN: Thank you.
JACKSON: I dig weddings. I do a mean chicken dance.
CRISTINA: Oh, there will be no chicken dance. And if you start a conga line, I will physically throw you out.
APRIL: I just went to cafeteria, and some nurse called me Reed and then said, "I thought you died."
LEXIE: Yeah, don't go to the cafeteria for lunch. They just point and stare.
JACKSON: Is that why you dyed your hair?
CRISTINA: They stare because we should've died.
LEXIE: Pack a lunch. Keep it in your locker.
MEREDITH: (Alex laughs) You are kidding me. You got cleared?
ALEX: It's down to you and Yang.
MEREDITH: That is not funny.
CRISTINA: Well, Perkins is no dummy. He can see the crazy right under the Meredith Grey surface.
MEREDITH: Again, Cristina, it's not funny because you're not gonna get cleared either, and the two of us are gonna be serving slushies at the multiplex.
CRISTINA: Really? I'd choose dermatology over multiplex.
JACKSON: No, I'd go gynecology over dermatology.
CRISTINA: Oh, of course you would. Perv.
LEXIE: I think I'd go with psych. That was a joke.
CRISTINA: (forced laughter) That was good.
MEREDITH: Anyway, I don't know what Perkins' problem is with me.
CRISTINA: Maybe he saw your file.
ALEX: Maybe he knew your mother.
JACKSON: Maybe he heard how you told the shooter to shoot you.
MEREDITH: Not funny.
JACKSON: Not a joke.
MEREDITH: Dr. Bailey.
APRIL: Welcome back.
ALEX: You okay?
MIRANDA: I'm happy to see you all. Karev, there's a patient in 23-04 that needs an endoscopy. Grey and Yang, surely your paycheck covers more than stuffing your face in the basement. Get to the clinic now. And, you two… I'm awful sorry about the loss of your friends.
APRIL: Thank you.
JACKSON: So are we.
MIRANDA: 22-13 has a bowel impaction, and I'm sure as hell not about to stick my hands in there.
DR PERKINS: You, uh, quit your job this morning. Should I be worried about impulsivity?
DEREK: (laughs) I didn't quit my job. Being chief wasn't my job. I'm a surgeon. That's what I do. That is who I am.
DR PERKINS: But before you got shot…
DEREK: Oh, I wanted to quit that job every day before I got shot, I just didn't have the guts to do it. After I got shot, I, uh... (gasps) Life is short. So now I think less and…
DR PERKINS: So... for you, the shooting was clarifying?
DEREK: A l… a lot of people died in that shooting.
DR PERKINS: I'm saying, in your life today…
DEREK: A lot of people died.
(flashback)
APRIL: Meredith went to get something to eat. (voice echoes) She should be back soon. (groans) Um... I'm sorry I got you shot. By coming out of the office… I didn't listen, and then you got shot. I… I got you shot, and I just need to
say, I am so…
DEREK: April…
APRIL: So sorry.
DEREK: Gary Clark came here for me. I gave the order to pull the plug on his wife. I got everyone shot.
MEREDITH: So-- oh! Is this what I need to do to get cleared?
DR PERKINS: (clears throat) Dr. Grey, you're early. I'll, uh, I'll call you later.
TEDDY: Yes, please.
MEREDITH: That was creepy and inappropriate. I want a new counselor.
DR PERKINS: Teddy was never a… a patient of mine. She was cleared for surgery before I got here. We just met in the cafeteria.
MEREDITH: I'm not interested in your love life. I don't care how love blooms over day-old hot dogs. My husband is about to remove the largest chordoma on record. You cleared Lexie Grey last week. You cleared Alex Karev, who insists on running around the hospital with a bullet in his chest.
DR PERKINS: I know who I've cleared.
MEREDITH: So then why don't you tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it.
DR PERKINS: Dr. Grey, I don't think that you're being honest… With me or yourself. And I think that's a potentially dangerous situation. So what is it that you're not saying?
(monitor beeping rhythmically) (flashback)
MEREDITH: Who's with Derek?
CRISTINA: Uh, when I left, um, Mark Sloan was with him.
MEREDITH: And where's Owen?
CRISTINA: Um, I don't know. I… I think he's still talking to the police.
MEREDITH: Okay, not a word of this to Derek. You have to tell Owen because he knows. Not a word.
CRISTINA: Okay.
MEREDITH: And April Kepner. She knows, too.
CRISTINA: Okay.
MEREDITH: Well, go… go… go tell them. Go… go back to the hospital and tell them right now.
CRISTINA: Don't you want me to stay for this?
MEREDITH: No, I want you to go. Go and… and make sure no one says a word to Derek.
CRISTINA: Okay. Okay.
(monitor beeping rhythmically) (sighs) (door opens)
DOCTOR: Your friend left? You want me to wait or...
MEREDITH: No, just do it.
DOCTOR: The d&c's pretty straightforward. The fetus was only at about 5 weeks. You'll feel some cramping after, but it shouldn't be too bad.
TEDDY: Andrew and I just got busted by Meredith Grey.
ARIZONA: Callie's watching me sleep.
TEDDY: What?
ARIZONA: She's watching me sleep. And she only watches me sleep when something is up, and I'm afraid that she's gonna propose or… start talking about making babies again, which I'm… I'm open to, honestly, just not right now, you know? And I can feel her watching me, and it is such hard work to keep my eyes closed, but I know that if I open them, that something loaded is gonna come out of her beautiful mouth and pop the pretty pink bubble that we've been floating in.
TEDDY: You want to pop the bubble.
ARIZONA: I don't, though.
TEDDY: Believe me. I've been living in that bubble for years. Oh, no. Owen and I? We're just friends, really. Finally knowing the truth? I don't regret that.
ARIZONA: My bubble is so pink and so... Pretty.
TEDDY: (taps pen on counter) Pop the bubble.
(Arizona sighs)
DEREK: I heard you were looking for me.
RICHARD: The board officially reinstated me this morning. No more "interim chief."
DEREK: Well, I'm glad to hear that.
RICHARD: You sure? No seller's remorse?
DEREK: Oh, have you seen the tumor I'm chasing? No, no seller's remorse.
RICHARD: You feel good about this surgery?
DEREK: That sounds like a loaded question.
RICHARD: Look, I know Perkins cleared you for surgery. Uh-huh. And I know better than to question your judgment, but... I still have nightmares, and I go to two A.A. Meetings a day. I'm not all the way back, and I didn't get shot. That's what I mean when I say, do you feel good about it?
DEREK: I feel adrenaline. And, yeah… The adrenaline feels good. (chuckles)
(buzzing)
MEREDITH: I can't believe I'm not down there. I can't believe I'm not down there.
MARK: Palate's divided. Torres.
CALLIE: Yeah. Okay. We're good.
MARK: Here we go.
RICHARD: You ever see anything like this?
OWEN: I've seen mortar fire that didn't do this much damage.
MARK: All right, let's bring that microscope in and get you started. Everybody’s ready?
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
DEREK: Okay. There's the tumor. We're there. Microdissectors, please.
MEREDITH: Get up.
CRISTINA: No.
MEREDITH: Get up. Ow! Ow! Ow! Let's go.
CRISTINA: What is wrong with you?
MEREDITH: Everything is wrong. Derek is decapitating a teenager, and April Kepner is assisting, and you're sitting reading about lilies of the freakin' valley.
CRISTINA: Well, you prefer peonies?
MEREDITH: We are not better. Cristina, a psychiatrist, given several opportunities, has deemed unfit to do my job.
CRISTINA: Well, he'll get over it. Just go back in a couple of days.
MEREDITH: You are not better.
CRISTINA: Well, in a couple of days, I'll be better, too.
MEREDITH: In a couple of days, you'll be married.
CRISTINA: Are you trying to talk me out of this?
MEREDITH: Look at me and tell me you're sure.
CRISTINA: Okay, you know what? No. You don't get to do this. Okay? All you get to do is help me break the tie between the lilies of the valley and the… and the peonies. That's it.
MEREDITH: No, I do get to do this. I mean, Derek’s the love of my life, but you're my soul mate. I do get to do this. I mean, why can't it wait six months?
CRISTINA: Please don't. Don't.
MEREDITH: Your flowers aren't going anywhere. You broke up with him because he couldn't choose you.
CRISTINA: Don't… don't… don't do this.
MEREDITH: Just why does it have to be right now?
CRISTINA: You know what I think? I think you should tell Derek about the miscarriage.
MEREDITH: We're talking about you.
CRISTINA: We're talking about us not being "better." Then you need to tell him.
MEREDITH: He's not ready. He's… he's not okay.
CRISTINA: Well, you're not okay. You should tell him.
DR PERKINS: Well, Dr. Yang, if you don't feel ready, there's no pressure. The hospital is prepared to work with you in whatever way…
CRISTINA: What… I'm sorry. I… I'm getting special treatment? 'cause I'm the girl who operated with a gun to her head? If you don't want to clear me, don't clear me.
DR PERKINS: Well, you didn't show up for your appointment last week. You were very late today.
CRISTINA: I'm getting married.
DR PERKINS: I heard that. Congratulations.
CRISTINA: Can I go now?
DR PERKINS: (chair wheels clatter) When you think about going into an O.R., how does that make you feel?
CRISTINA: God, the women in these magazines... (pages rustle) Some of them are actually brides, you know? They're not all models. All smiling. It's like the only thing in the world that matters is that they find the perfect shoe to match that dress. (inhales deeply) God, you know, I knew these girls. I w… I went to school with them. It's funny. I used to feel sorry for them. They're simple girls. They just want to find the guy and get married, you know… and live. (magazine pages rustle) I don't know. I think you're earthborn simple or you're born… me. I want to be the person who gets happy over finding the perfect dress. I want to be simple. Because no one holds a gun to the head of a simple girl. ‘Stop fixing him! (crying) Owen, help.’
(bang) (flashback)
CRISTINA: Who is it?
OWEN: I… it's me. It's Owen. Hey.
CRISTINA: (chain rattles) You're late.
OWEN: I'm sorry. Hey.
CRISTINA: It's not okay.
OWEN: Cristina, what is this?
CRISTINA: (voice breaks) I don't want to be alone.
OWEN: You don't ever have to be alone again. I'm not going anywhere, Cristina. I won't ever leave again. You hear me? I am not going anywhere, Cristina... If you let me stay.
CRISTINA: Thank you.
OWEN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was late.
CRISTINA: Thank you. Thank you. (cries) thank you.
BEN: Miranda, look, um… Look, um… I… I was playing golf. And I… I can't apologize for it because it wasn't anything I did on purpose. I was just… I was playing golf. I missed you, and I just…
MIRANDA: You're… You're a good man. You are handsome… And kind… And smart. I mean, you're perfect. But, um… I'm… Busy. Holding myself together with tape and glue. And a piece of me wishes that you hadn't played golf, because… (voice breaking) then you'd be all taped and glued, too. And maybe you'd be where I am.
BEN: Shh. I...
MIRANDA: (crying) You're… You're too much for me right now, 'cause I'm busy with the tape and the glue.
BEN: (whispering) Shh. Shh. All right, all right. All right. All right. You take care of yourself.
MIRANDA: You, too.
MEREDITH: You were amazing in there.
DEREK: Let's make a baby.
MEREDITH: What?
DEREK: Mm-hmm. Come on. (clears throat) Let's do it. Let's start right now. Let's just pull the goal view… (pager beeps) Oh, god. It's Greg. Damn it.
APRIL: I… I already gave him 10 of morphine. He's in too much pain. I'm gonna start him on propofol.
DONNA: (crying) Greg. I never should've let you do this. I never should've let you.
DEREK: All right, Greg. It's Dr. Shepherd. You have to listen to me. Greg. Greg. Greg, this is the fight. T… The pain's gonna stop. We're gonna help you. But until it does, this is your fight. The tumor's not driving anymore. You are. You're in the driver's seat. The life that's in your head? You get if you fight. (beeping continues) You got it? Good. Good. Donna look, this… This pain? Yeah. It's not a dying pain. It's a healing pain. This is a victory pain. (Donna’s sobs) You won. (monitor beeping rhythmically) We won.
DEREK: Hey. (chuckles) (sighs) what? What? I went out to get some ice. Oh, don't be mad. We'll make the wedding.
MEREDITH: Mm. I'll make the wedding. Just wanted to see you were alive for myself.
DEREK: Meredith. (chuckles) Meredith. (cell door closes)
(playing discordant notes) (spoon clatters)
ALEX: You ok hot. The whole, uh, "crazy eyes, tight dress" thing, it's, uh, it's working for you, for whatever it's worth.
LEXIE: You think that you are so badass 'cause you lived. I'm the reason that you lived. And while you were dying, you were crying out for the wife who left you. So that's the opposite of badass, for whatever it's worth.
MARK: I'm jealous. (Callie sighs) I think I'm jealous of Hunt and Yang. Mm. You know Derek’s gonna be the best man? We hardly even know the guy.
CALLIE: I'm gonna do it.
MARK: You're drunk.
CALLIE: That's why I'm gonna do it.
ARIZONA: Lame surgery ran long. Sorry. What'd I miss?
CALLIE: I have something... to ask you.
ARIZONA: Oh, no.
CALLIE: I want you to move in with me. I love you, and you have a drawer and a toothbrush, and I want you to have a whole dresser and a whole… blow-dryer or something… more romantic than that or… Something.
MARK: You're doing great. Push through.
CALLIE: (whispers) okay. (normal voice) Unless you're just totally hating the idea, which… would be okay.
ARIZONA: Is that it?
CALLIE: Is what it?
ARIZONA: You just want me to move in to a place that I basically already live?
CALLIE: Mm-hmm.
ARIZONA: (whispers) thank god. (normal voice) Yes, yes. Calliope, yes. I would love to have a dresser and a blow-dryer or something more romantic.
CALLIE: Oh! (laughs)
MEREDITH: Oh. How are you doing? You okay?
OWEN: Yeah. I'm okay. Uh, Derek?
MEREDITH: Uh, I'm sorry. He's not coming.
OWEN: Um... He's my best man.
MEREDITH: I know. Do you want to pick a new one? Mark looks great in a suit.
OWEN: Derek had the ring.
MEREDITH: I have it.
OWEN: Oh, okay.
MEREDITH: Are you still good?
OWEN: Yeah.
MEREDITH: Okay.
OWEN: She is gonna come down those stairs, right?
CRISTINA: I never gave you any crap about your post-it.
MEREDITH: You look beautiful.
CRISTINA: I know. How's Owen? Is he good?
MEREDITH: Owen's perfect. He's perfect.
CRISTINA: Thank you.
MEREDITH (VOIX OFF): When we say things like, "people don't change". It drives scientists crazy… because change is literally the only constant in all of science.
OWEN: Thank you.
MEREDITH (VOIX OFF): Energy… Matter… It's always changing… Morphing… Merging… Growing… Dying. It's the way people try not to change that's unnatural… The way we cling to what things were instead of letting them be what they are… The way we cling to old memories instead of forming new ones… The way we insist on believing… despite every scientific indication… that anything in this lifetime is permanent. Change is constant. How we experience change… That's up to us. It can feel like death… Or it can feel like a second chance at life. If we open our fingers, loosen our grips, go with it… It can feel like pure adrenaline… Like at any moment… We can have another chance at life… Like at any moment…
CRISTINA: I do.
MEREDITH (VOIX OFF): We can be born all over again.And it was so scary, seeing Derek lying on the floor bleeding like that.
So scary.
It feels good just to, you know, get that out, you know?
Thank you.
Thank you.
I feel like I'm ... Ready to go back to work.
It doesn't happen often.
Lightning usually gets it right the first time.
Okay, let's, uh ... Talk more about that tomorrow.
come on.
Do you need a-a tissue or ... A hug or something?
Go hug yourself.
When you're hit with
30, 000 ampers of electricity, you feel it.
Morning.
Morning.
It can make you forget who you are.
Just ... just ... Stay calm. Breathe. Take some deep breaths.
We're ... we're just married.
And we're just gonna get up and go to work like always.
I've got this under control. Now ... now you need to eat this, a little multigrain, and then we're just gonna go to work.
Work is what you need right now, okay?
We're gonna get a little blood on those hands.
That'll feel good. Okay? Let's just get up, get naked, get in the shower, have a little morning soapy s*x, then I'm gonna wash your hair.
I've always wanted to wash your hair.
It can burn you, blind you, stop your heart ... Sounds big. I'm betting m. V. C.
Multiple m. V. C. Or an apartment fire.
When is the staring gonna stop?
As soon as the novelty wears off. Just ignore them.
Owen washed my hair.
And he told me to eat this grainy nut bar.
And he booked me into surgery this morning.
He is in charge of me. I'm a bride, and I'm going with it.
But trauma guy didn't clear you. Yeah, but he said he'll figure that out.
Yes. Okay, I am the crazy one.
I am the one who freaks out and screams at people ... Like that.
Go gawk at each other for a while.
Are you okay?
Would everybody please just stop asking if I am okay? Okay?
And cause massive internal injuries no? Still?
I resorted to tears.
I wore bad mascara so he wouldn't miss them.
What ... what did Derek say?
Oh, I will be avoiding him today.
So you don't have to talk to him about the baby thing?
No.
Oh. Because you left him in the pokey.
Yeah.
But for something that happens in only a millisecond ... Did you feel different?
You know, after you scribbled on the post-it?
I mean, you're supposed to feel different, right?
Oh, well, it takes take. Give it some time.
Okay.
I mean, your marriage is filled with secrets and felons.
I mean, why am I
asking your advice?
It can change your life forever.
Dr. Shepherd, the chief is looking for you.
I know.
You missed the wedding last night.
I know.
You smell like ***.
I know.
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm. How was the wedding?
It was fine. I'm sorry you missed it.
Yeah, well, I was busy getting an incarceration record.
Do you know what that means?
It means you drive too fast. Oh, God.
Derek, you smell like ... - yeah, I know what I smell like.
I have go to the pit.
They cleared you for surgery?
No, but I can still do consults.
So sorry. Bye.
We're not done talking about this.
Oh, God. All right. Did a bus crash?
Okay, I'm not saying rip out walls.
I'm saying throw some paint up on 'em.
You know, soften it up. Yang decorated the place for her, and it's just a little harsh and frowny.
Okay. I'm gonna stop you right there, 'cause Yang doesn't decorate.
I decorated that place. It's my frowny place.
I meant modern and edgy.
If it's gonna be our place, I just need it to be a little more smiley.
Ugh. My God.
I ... frowny?
Edgy.
Wh ... watch it!
Sorry.
Karev?
Dr. Bailey?
You still have that bullet in your chest?
Uh, oh, yeah. It worked its way to the surface.
It's fine. We leave bullets in people all the time.
It must hurt. Does it hurt? Uh, nope.
Does it hurt when I do this?
Ow! Damn!
It is not fine.
It is foreign, and it has no business being in your body.
Get it out, Karev, or I'll see to it that you won't operate until you're operated on.
Andrew Perkins hasn't signed off on her.
You disagree with him?
No. Keeping residents out of the O.R. until they're ready is the right approach for most of them, but not for Cristina.
She won't feel like herself until she's back in surgery again.
You know Yang.
I do.
And you want to start her on an ex vivo heart reconstruction?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime it is a hell of a lot of pressure is what it is.
Well, she operated on ... I mean, she saved Derek Shepherd with a gun to her head.
I don't think that pressure is the issue for her.
We owe her this, Richard, and she needs it.
Put her back in the game.
Linda Cotler, age 51, has been here three times in the last eight years for removal of malignant myxomas from her heart.
But we won't be doing that again.
No, by removing both atria, and hopefully all the cancerous cells, you won't have to keep coming back here.
Hello, Dr. Yang. Nice to see a familiar face.
Finally, someone we know.
Mrs. Cotler was a patient of Dr. Burke's.
You assisted on her last myxoma removal of course. - Of course. Hi.
You were getting married, weren't you?
Sorry?
Well, got married. I mean, last night, actually.
You and Dr. Burke?
Sorry?
Last time we were here, he said you two were getting married.
Oh, yes.
No. That ... that didn't happen.
Oh.
What a shame. He went on and on about you.
But you did get married?
We did, last night. Yes, we did.
Oh.
Well, nice to see you again.
Well, uh, sit tight, and we'll be back in with some forms for you to sign, and then we'll take you up.
Thanks, Dr. Altman, and congratulations to you two.
Thank you.
Okay, multiple burn victims.
Two with paralysis, three with vision loss, one, uh, blown eardrums, and one dislocated hip.
House fire?
Explosion?
Car wreck?
Uh, act of God.
Act of God?
Yeah, lightning strike.
All that from one lightning strike?
One lightning strike, eight victims.
Took out a whole flag football team.
God was in a mood today.
How did it strike all of 'em?
Well, they're mostly flash burns, so it probably hit one of them then conducted off onto the rest.
Lexie.
T. M. Rupture, trauma one.
I'll see you in there.
Tell me something.
When a person gets out of the nut house. .
What's the appropriate amount of time to wait before you propose?
What? Long.
Longer. Long ... a long time.
Not now.
Specifically, how long?
Have you seen my friend Kerry?
She's ... she's a girl. Sh-she's the only girl.
Whoa. Whoa.
You've just got some ferning here.
It's superficial. It's where the electrons entered the skin.
Well, what about my arm? I still can't feel my arm.
Sit forward.
Hi.
Uh, hi. You changed.
Yeah, and showered, twice, thanks to you.
This is Russ.
He was struck by lightning while playing flag football, and he's complaining of paralysis in his left arm.
Can you move your fingers for me?
Yeah, see, I couldn't do that when I first got here.
It's probably just transitory paralysis, which is mon with lightning strikes.
Can you feel that?
Little bit, yeah.
We're gonna keep watching you, but your arm should come back to normal in a couple of hours.
You know they almost revoked my driver's license?
Can somebody please check on Kerry for me?
Happy to. Right away.
Hey, we're still not done talking about this.
Okay, wiggle your toes for me.
I still can't. Am I gonna be in a wheelchair?
We're gonna take you in for a C.T. , but hopefully, it is just temporary, from the lightning.
Couple of your friends have it, too.
They're already starting to get some feeling back.
Okay.
Try not to worry.
Hey, Kerry. A friend of yours, Russ Gammie, is asking about you.
How's Warren Griffith?
Is he okay? Did he ask about me?
Which one is Warren?
Excuse me. Excuse me. I ... who's this, Russ or Warren?
Mitch?
Mitch now?
Hey, have you seen Warren? Is he okay?
Kerry, I gotta say this.
We both could've died out there.
That lightning bolt was like a one-in-a-million shot, so I gotta take one, too.
I love you, Kerry, and if we get through this, I want you to know, I will love you forever.
What?
Sir, I'm sorry. If you're not being treated, then you're gonna have to go to the waiting room.
We'll ... we'll keep you posted.
Kerry, can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you fine.
I just didn't want him to know that I heard that.
You're a popular girl.
No. I'm sure he's just overexcited.
It is like a one-in-a-million thing.
Actually, it's more like a
1-in-6, 250 kind of thing.
Lightning kills between 150 to 300
people every year in the U. S. alone.
Lexie.
Well, no, I mean, it's ... it's still rare.
I mean, it's not, like, say, handgun death.
I mean, that's ... that's 1 in 325.
Lexie.
You okay?
Yeah. No, I'm saying-
I'm saying she's lucky.
That's ... you know, hey, yay, you.
Can someone just please check on Warren for me?
I need to know if he's okay. Is Warren your boyfriend?
No. He's ... No.
Okay.
Well, you've got two burdrums, but they will heal themselves, too.
Great. Thank you.
Does that mean there's no surgery? Can I go?
'Cause Dr. Shepherd's here, so he might have something.
Maybe you should stick with me.
Kerry will need a workup.
I'm sorry. Why is this better than what Dr. Burke did?
Dr. Burke's approach was conservative and correct for the first few surgeries.
This is radical and risky, but ... well, it sounds like it's gonna kill her.
Linda's heart wall has grown weaker with every surgery, so there are greater odds of cardiac rupture.
This may be her last chance.
Paul ... honey, every two years, we come here, they cut me open, and I watch it take ten years off of your life.
I can't do it anymore.
And neither can you.
What about you?
Do you think this is the best idea?
Oh, I'm not, um ... because what you and Dr. Burke did, it's kept her with me so far.
If this was your husband, would you let Dr. Altman tear apart his heart?
Yes.
An aggressive approach is your only option.
This is what you want.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
We'll see you in there.
Oh. What are these?
Choices.
They're all beige.
No, they're all subtle.
Look, pastels and earth tones.
If you look closely, that's blue, that's green, that's yellow ... to take the edge off all the chrome and concrete.
What do you think?
I think I don't want to live in an Easter basket.
I know. You really want to live in the batcave.
But meet me halfway.
Uh, yes. Schultz, Kerry? Yes, thank you.
Okay, uh, my patient's scans are up.
And, uh, seriously ... They're all beige to me.
W-well, then it shouldn't be hard to pick one.
I'm looking for Warren Griffith.
That's me.
Oh. I feel kind of queasy.
You've got a little fever. That may be why.
You got hit the hardest.
Looks like it went into your neck and came out your foot.
And you're saying it bounced off me and hit everyone else?
I took out the whole team?
It's not like it's your fault.
It kinda feels that way. I don't remember any of it.
How about my friend Kerry? Is she okay?
She's wondering the same thing about you.
She what? She asked about me?
Specifically?
Well, what did she say?
Are you people in junior high?
I almost told her. I tried to. I ... I'm gonna tell her.
What are you talking about?
Kerry. I tried to tell her I-I love her, but her ... her ears are all messed up and- - ah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You gotta sit down.
Where are you going?
I gotta tell her. I get to tell her.
G-guys, look, leave her alone. All right? She coulda died out there.
And besides, she's, like, mine.
No, I'v been working up to this for a year.
No, no, no, you've gotta sit.
She's mine, and I love her.
I've been working up to this for a year.
You need to come back here and sit down!
Popular girl.
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Yep, C.T. looks clear. No damage to your spine.
Which means I can go?
It means you should observe her.
Guys, you can't be in here.
Everybody, shut up. Shut up.
Okay, Warren. You talk.
Kerry, I ... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Page Bailey!
Warren, you have a perforation ... a hole ... somewhere in your bowel.
We're gonna have to take you up to surgery.
Tell Kerry I'm sorry.
Tell her I'm sorry I
hit her with lightning.
Hey, don't you worry.
No, she's just the sweetest, funniest ... she's just ... just please make sure she's okay.
Okay. We will.
We're gonna take care of you now.
All right, who do I have? Who's free?
I'm free. I'm good. I'll go.
He's my patient. I'll take him.
Ow! Book an O.R. you can observe.
I'm fine, and I'm free.
B ... what are you doing?
Nothing.
Other Grey, are you free to scrub in?
Absolutely. I ... I'm available, 'cause you haven't been cleared for surgery, right?
April, if we're gonna be friends ... You have to stop doing that.
Sorry. Habit.
I'm standing right here. Kepner, go prep him.
Okay. I'll see you up there.
I'm fine.
Well, great. Then you can keep an eye on Kerry.
I'll resect both atria ... And build new ones out of bovine pericardium.
And during reconstruction, Dr. Hunt will stay with Linda, using a human donor aorta to prepare the vessels for reimplantation.
And all of this in just four hours?
We have to be fast. We all set?
Let's go.
All right. Prep her and page me when she's ready sure.
Cristina.
Are you excited?
Yes, absolutely.
Good. Good.
The fear of going back in is worse than actually doing it.
It's just getting back on the horse is all it is.
This is one hell of a honeymoon, right?
Incision looks great.
Hey, I hear you and Torres are shacking up.
Uh, uh, yeah.
Do I sound more excited than you?
No, no. I am. I am.
How's it going with the hot, hot trauma counselor?
I have to say ... It's great.
The conversation never stops, and I feel, um ... I don't know. I feel good whenever I see him.
No heart murmur. Good girl.
What do you talk about? What's he like?
He's, um ... well, he likes to, uh ... I guess I-I mostly talk, and he mostly listens.
He's ... he's an amazingly good listener.
Well, he should be. It's what he gets paid for.
Yeah.
Warren?
You love Warren?
Warren's bald, Kerry.
I know that, Mitch.
You guys don't love me.
I'm a girl who's down with flag football, so you think you love me.
Plus, we got struck by lightning, so that's ... Nice. You made her cry.
Oh, crap. You know, sorry.
You know, Warren's a good guy.
He could probably get a hairpiece or something and ... she's crying because everything's changed.
Okay? Lightning struck, and everything changed.
You were her team.
She was one of you, and ... and now you're just ... you're looking at her differently.
Um, n-no.
I'm crying because I'm worried about Warren.
Could you please find out if he's okay?
Really?
This is what I'm cleared to do.
I'm cleared to solve this puzzle.
Don't buy a vowel, you idiot.
Scarlet pimpernel.
How did you ... there was one "c" and an "m."
Have you talked to Derek yet about the ... today's not the day.
Right. He just got out of the joint.
Let him ease back into society.
You ready?
You up for this? Up for what?
Teddy's rebuilding a woman's atrium out of a sack of cow meat.
But you're not nervous at all?
You're lucky. I get to watch an intestinal perf repair.
Bailey won't let me operate till I get this bullet out.
I'll take it out.
I'll cut it out right now.
You sound like a junkie.
What the hell is a pimpernel?
Kerry wants to know how Warren's doing?
Intestinal perf. Going to surgery.
I'm never gonna operate again.
Everyone thinks I'm gonna carve my initials into a patie.
I'll never operate again because one man thinks I'm crazy.
Hey, guys, look at this. Look at this.
A bystander's cell phone captured the shocking end to a flag football practice in lawton park this morning.
Oh! Oh! Oh, my ... Ooh. We've got that amazing footage, plus all your news traffic and weather, coming up after this.
Oh, my God. She never saw it coming.
No. No. No, no, no.
$50 says she back in the cuckoo's next by lunch.
Hey, how was your night in jail?
You shank someone right off the b?
You gotta let the other cons know not to mess with you.
That's not funny.
They almost charged me with reckless endangerment.
I'm sorry. What?
You mean that's where you've been all morning, in jail for reckless endangerment?
Nobody was endangered.
I can't have this, Derek. I wot. Now ... have you ever been over
120 miles an hour before?
Richard, have you ever been over 80? It's fun.
It's really fun. I mean, especially when you go through a corner like that at that speed, and ... and you're not sure if the rear end's gonna stick or not, and you lose control, and th you put the throttle down, and the car corrects a little bit, and you take it to the limit and you don't lose control, you just grab it. Have you ever done it?
Uh, uh, no, Derek, no.
You want to? I'll take you.
You should. It's ... really great.
Let's go right now. Let's do it. Come on.
I'd like that.
Yeah? Right? Good. We're going. Oh.
You need to help me. I need your help. Hey.
What? Okay.
She's paralyzed, and it's not gonna go away.
She's not gonna get any better.
Lexie, hold on. You're all right.
No, n-not me. It's Kerry Schultz.
She got hit outta nowhere, and it's not gonna get any better.
I need you to listen to me.
Look, this has nothing to do with that. She's ... no, just shut up and please listen to me.
Make sure she's all right.
I'm trying.
120 miles an hour.
I'm glad you're back, that we're gonna be in there together.
It makes me a little less freaked out is what I'm saying.
Is this gonna become a thing ... you sharing all your sad, scared feelings because we almost got shot together?
There it is.
Now I know you're back.
This boy got it bad. Okay, throw a stitch in there.
Suction.
Staph infection, which causes cellulitis, an abscess, possibly mrsa, which could lead to sepsis and death.
Uh, I'm sorry. Where are you seeing all of this?
In Dr. Karev's chest if he doesn't have that bullet removed.
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
Can I leave now?
No, you can stand right there to make sure you don't get into anyone else's O.R. , not until you're lead-free.
All right.
The heart is ready.
Okay. Here we go.
Start the clock. Dr. Yang ... Take the heart, please.
Badass.
All right. Here we go.
Excising the right atrium.
Welcome back, Dr. Yang.
Thank you.
See?
You went down before the lightning even struck.
Oh, my God. Warren. I never even saw him coming.
Is he okay? He's in surgery now.
Kerry, your new scan shows an epidural hematoma.
It's blood in your spine that's compressing your spinal cord.
We didn't see that before?
Probably too small to see, and it's been bleeding for hours.
It's an easy procedure to relieve the pressure.
And I'll walk again?
You'll be out on the field in no time. Book an O.R.
I'll see you in there.
F-for an actual surgery?
Yes.
Thank you.
Oh, so stupid.
All this time ... I never told him.
And I-I had all these reasons, you know?
And ... they seemed like good reasons until we all almost died.
I was worried about, what, about shaking up the team?
It's flag football. We play once a week.
God, I'm an idiot.
I thought you were in surgery.
Yeah, the guy pulled through.
Is Lexie okay?
Why don't you ask yourself?
She doesn't need me talking to her.
Well, you're the one who ended it.
Yeah, it ended the way it always ends.
I get close to the chick, the chick goes crazy.
Rebecca and Izzie, my mom ... I'm a lightning rod for this crap.
You're not that special.
Lexie's not crazy.
She had a crazy thing happen to her, and her reaction was pretty normal.
And Izzie had brain cancer.
Rebecca ... she was crazy, but that was the facial reconstruction trauma.
You're not a lightning rod, Alex.
You're just a guy who's been through a lot of crap.
I wish I had a scalpel right now.
Junkie.
Time, please.
2 hours and 42 minutes.
We're behind. Dr. Hunt, where are you at?
Putting in the aortic graft.
This tissue is more than I need.
Dr. Yang, trim this pericardium, please.
3 centimeters.
Okay.
Avery, give me some irrigation in here, please.
Sure.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
All right. Are we all right? It's all right. It's all right.
It was just a tray. The aortic cannula is dislodged.
Avery, some suction in here, please.
Hunt, talk to me.
I need a purse string in the aorta.
Avery, get me some more visualization in here, please.
Get in there.
Yang, come help me. Yang?
Cristina?
Cristina, talk to me.
Oh, damn it. Grab the aortic cannula.
Hold it there.
Cristina, you are okay.
Can you get up?
Avery, I need that tissue now.
Is it usable?
No.
Aah! No! No!
Time, please.
Time! Uh, 2 hours, 45.
All right, Avery, call down to the pharmacy and get another piece of tissue, please.
No, don't call. Cristina. Cristina, you go.
Go now and get one.
Run. Go.
Look, I'll just go. I got it.
The dura is pulsatile.
Good catch, Dr. Grey.
Thank you, and, um, thank you for listening to me and for not being afraid of me.
Nobody's afraid of you.
Mark's keeping me chained to his service.
He's keeping me out of surgeries.
Because he's afraid for you. So he hovers.
Other people might lock you in a cell overnight to be urinated on by a meth hea.
But it all comes from the same place.
Oh, you ... you-you can't be in here.
But we're friends now, so I'll just shut up.
Good girl.
Dr. Grey, you shouldn't be in the O.R.
Cristina.
Cristina.
I can't be in here.
I can't.
Okay, so let's go. Let's get out of here.
I can't ... I c-
I can't feel anything.
I know.
I know.
Come with me.
No, no. I ... I can't move.
I can't move my legs.
I can't ... I can't feel anything.
F-f-feel my hand. Take my hand.
Do you feel that?
Okay.
You're okay.
We're gonna go when you're ready.
Okay?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So you tell me when you're ready, okay?
Okay. Okay.
Is it over?
How is she?
Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry.
No, no. No, no ... I-I ... she's fine. Uh, the doctors are still working, and someone will be out when they're finished.
You're wrong.
Sorry?
There's no time to wait.
People get struck by lightning.
People die.
My best friend got shot, Torres.
Why are you telling me to give it time when there's no guarantee that time is gonna be there?
I'm ... not gonna wait around to be happy anymore.
All right. Listen, this is something that you and I do.
We skip steps.
Okay, I pushed Arizona to have a baby, and I almost lost her because I skipped a bunch of steps.
But then I went back, and now she's moving in ... And ruining my apartment.
Look, I'm saying, proposing might be too much, especially if she's not herself right now.
I know who she is, and if she's going through her worst right now, I wanna go through it with her.
She makes me happier than ... Anything I've ever known.
And if I can have a part in ... in making her happy again, that's all I want to do.
That's all I want to do for the rest of my life.
All right.
All right. Go.
Go. Tell her that. But just like that.
Is she dead?
She's fine. She'll be fine.
Can you give us a minute?
You were wrong.
You were wrong about everything.
I know. I'm sorry.
Hey, I heard about Cristina. Is she all right?
No, she's not all right. No one's all right.
And that idiot is clearing everyone for surgery like they're fine, and they're not fine.
Stop. Stop. I need to talk to you.
Just leave it alone, Derek. It was one night in jail.
You drive too fast. Just forget about it.
I don't want to talk about that. Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it? All I do is worry all the time.
I spend every minute of every day worrying that I'm gonna get a phone call that you've wrapped your car around a pole.
That's why I left you jail, so that just for a little while, I would know that you weren't dying like you were dying on that table.
That's what I think about every time you pull out of the driveway.
I'm right here. I'm okay.
We're okay.
I was pregnant ... that day.
I was pregnant, and I lost it.
You didn't say anything.
I coulda helped you.
If you want to help me, your driving is something you can control.
Just do that. Just do that.
Okay. Okay.
What happened in the O.R. , we couldn't have seen that.
I-I can't ... I can't do it.
You said I could do it.
I know. I know. I ... I thought you were ready.
You've never not been ready.
Cristina, I know what you're feeling.
I don't feel anything.
I can't be in there.
And if I can't be in there, I don't know where I'm supposed to be.
You're supposed to be here. You're my wife.
You can just be here.
I'm sorry.
You up for a visitor?
Kerry?
Oh, my God. Warren?
Are you okay?
Um, they ... they told me that I slammed you really hard on the field and ... oh, it's okay.
Accidents happen. It's ... it's football.
I'm fine.
Well, they also told me that I ... I got you all struck by lightning.
That's ... I ... that's ... I just ... I wanted to say, I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I love you.
I've been in love with you forever.
Dr. Grey, can you please push me a-a little closer?
Lightning doesn't often strike twice.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Even if it feels like the shock is coming over and over again ... You paged me?
I did. I have a surgery.
You're actually gonna let me near a patient?
You are the patient.
Get in there and get on that table.
I don't need a reminder of this thing.
I'm gonna carry that day around with me every day for the rest of my life whether I want to not.
Now they've plastered over every bullet hole in this building.
I don't need a reminder every time I look at you.
And I'm tired of bullying you, so I am asking you, please, get in there and get your shirt off.
Yes, ma'am.
Eventually ... The pain will go away, the shock will wear off ... Oh, hey. You ready to go?
I, uh, I pushed our reservation.
Do I talk too much?
I'm enjoying you and ... and this.
And I feel good when I'm with you, but ... it occurs to me, well, that's your job ... I mean, to come in here and to listen to people talk and to make them feel good, and I just ... I want to be sure that I'm not using you for that, you know, and that I'm not doing all the talking and the ... and the good feeling and that I'm ... I'm ... I'm not treating you like a ... like a ... well, like a ... like a shrink.
'Cause I'm enjoying this.
Now you talk.
Well ... Listening to you is not work.
I'm happy to talk, but I have listened a lot today.
I talked a lot, too.
And so for now, I'd like to say ... I'm enjoying this, too.
And, uh ... maybe we can both not talk for a while?
Okay.
Yeah.
And you start to heal yourself ... Did you know that Webber went over my head and cleared Yang for your O.R. ?
We ... we really don't have to ... to talk.
Come here. Yeah?
Yeah.
Lexie.
Did I forget to clean something?
No. I just need to talk to you.
No ... you don't, though.
I know that you want to be here, but you don't have to.
W-wait.
I went through a rough patch, and you helped me, and I appreciate that.
But I am moving out of it, and you won't let me.
You know, you're treating me like I am a basket case.
And ... and ... and everyone is watching you, and they're believing you.
I had a good day today.
I saved a girl today. I did that.
I am a good doctor, and I don't deserve for people to think that I
am anything less than that.
So could you please just leave me alone?
Can you do that? Can you just leave me alone?
You got it.
To recover from something you never saw coming.
Charles was a good guy.
He was funny.
Reed ... well, she was kind of messed up, but she wasn't a bad person.
I just don't ... I don't know why ... I shouldn't just get to walk away, you know?
I don't know why we made it either.
We just have to find a way to be grateful.
Son of a bitch.
Agreed.
Paint it beige.
You got a girl ... You love who loves you back.
Paint it whatever stupid color she wants.
But sometimes, the odds are in your favor.
50% of marriages end in divorce, so between the two of us, you and McDreamy should be fine.
I thought it would fix me.
That's not why he married you.
Well, he didn't marry me. He married a corpse.
I'm dead inside.
I told Derek.
About the miscarriage, I told him.
You got married, Cristina, for better or for worse.
This is the worse part.
The thing is, there will be better parts.
You should go back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Cristina ... You don't feel nothing.
All right?
You didn't feel nothing today.
You felt scared. You were terrified.
And you felt anger. You were angry at me.
And after what you've been through, you're allowed, all right?
That's what you should be feeling. I know.
Bee when I was there, I felt all those things, and I ... I took it all out on you.
And you were patient, and you were kind, and you stayed through it all because you love me.
You love me.
So, uh ... You can be scared with me, or you can be pissed with me or at me.
I don't care, 'cause I'm gonna stay through it all.
I'm not going anywhere, Cristina.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Let's go home.
I had already fixed her before you came, but ... that was a nice speech.
If you're in just the right place at just the right time ... You can take a hell of a hit ... I lost a baby, I almost lost my husband, and my best friend may never recover.
So I don't care what you do. Clear me or don't clear me.
I have no control over any of it.
I'm giving up.
Well ... That sounds like a good plan.
You're cleared for surgery, Dr. Grey.
And still have a shot at surviving.Cristina?
Owen's at the hospital, and I ... Forget it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on.
Come on.
Well, that's ... that's ... that's kinda weird.
Oh, he's asleep. Get in.
Most surgeons grew up being freaks.
While other kids played outside ... We holed up in our rooms ... Memorizing the periodic table ... Huddling for hours over our junior microscopes ... Dissecting our first frog.
Almost all of the surgeons in your program have been cleared to operate.
The remaining cases will be referred to Dr. Wyatt, and she'll clear those people when she feels they're ready.
What about Cristina Yang? What's the timeline there?
Dr. Perkins felt that we should assign Dr. Yang to something low-stress for a few months ... research, admin duties.
Administration? That's the best you can do?
Put her on my service.
She's not on anyone's service, Derek.
She'll be in the hospital, she just won't go near a surgery.
Well, you do that, and she'll leave.
She will not come back to this program.
Put her on my service. I already tried it, Shepherd.
Well, Hunt's right. She's not ready.
She wasn't ready before. Maybe now she is.
I think we should give him a shot.
Well, especially if nothing else is working.
She crawled under a table in the O.R. two weeks ago.
Thank you.
She goes, I go.
That's insane.
If she goes, I go.
I think they're talking about you.
It's gonna be okay. I mean, they ... they ... they can't kick you out of the program for being traumatized.
I don't care what they do.
Dr. Yang, you're with me.
What? N-no.
I'm with you.
You're with somebody else. We're walking, Dr. Yang.
Derek.
Hey.
Where could I find Dr. Shepherd?
You have an appointment?
I don't.
Uh, could you just point me in the direction of his office?
I'm sorry.
She has that look on her face because the last time someone walked into this hospital looking for Dr. Shepherd without an appointment, he shot him.
Mark! Oh.
Oh, my God!
Hi, Amy. You still look hot.
And you, uh, look a lot more grown-up than when I last saw you.
You can say "hot, " you know? 'Cause I am. I'm hot.
No, I can't, because in my mind, you're still Derek's 12-year-old sister.
Huh. So what are you doing in Seattle?
Uh, Derek's an ass who won't return my calls.
Derek's an ass who got shot and won't return my calls, so I brought him a present or a bribe or a peace offering.
Whatever. I brought him that.
Imagine how surprised and relieved we were when we grew up and found out there were others out there just as freaky as we were ... You brought him Brett Favre?
No. I brought him a brain tumor.
Same microscopes, same dead frogs, same inexplicable urge to take human beings apart.
Talk to Cristina.
She's in the middle of a nervous breakdown.
I can't push her.
In two weeks, my landlord is gonna hand keys to a Swedish couple with a truckload of Swedish furniture, and I said I'd be gone.
Teddy, can you ... mention it to Owen, like casually, "hey, how's the apartment search going?
No pressure, but Callie and Arizona have a life."
"You're crowding them, and Arizona can't handle it."
Oh, my God. Are ... Teddy, are you okay?
Andrew's leaving.
Oh. Oh, no, you didn't. She got attached.
Oh, no. No, no, no. You were supposed to be smart and cool and g. I. Jane.
I know that. I know that. Instead, I got attached to the trauma guy who swoops in and swoops out a month later.
I'm such an idiot. I'm not g. I. Jane.
I'm attachment Barbie.
Oh, you poor thing. Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.
You know what would make you feel better?
What?
Telling Owen to get off his ass and get his traumatized wife out of our apartment.
Meredith is a much better doctor than me.
No, she's not.
I am, too. Sorry, Cristina.
Oh, no. No offense taken. She ... she is.
I'll take my chances.
Okay, how about we compromise?
Why don't you page me when you've got something?
I've got something.
Oh, come on.
Amy?
Well, if you'd pick up the damn phone, I wouldn't have to stalk you.
Yeah. Why didn't you call your sister?
Sister?
Meredith, Cristina, this is Amy.
Amelia.
He's the only one who gets to call me Amy.
Um, nice to finally meet you.
Likewise.
Amy ... Amelia ... is also a neurosurgeon.
Another one? You Shepherds grow them like weeds.
Who's this, your husband?
Derek, this is Tom.
Todd.
Oh, best of luck to you both.
No, we met on the plane. He has a probable pituitary tumor.
Did she say you had spongy hands?
Yeah.
Yeah. Were your hands on her breasts at the time?
Yeah.
So this was a mile-high hookup?
That doesn't change the fact that he's a very sick man.
If he has symptoms, it could be a tumor.
Not just "could." It ... it is.
All right. Well, his fine lady will find you a surgeon.
Derek, she's your sister.
You can buy her a cup of coffee.
I have a lot of sisters, and if I bought them all coffee, we wouldn't have anything.
Derek - all right, Todd needs a workup. Will you take care of it?
I can do it.
Yang's on my service.
Why don't you just go have a good day with Amy, okay?
She's a laugh a minute.
Can you hold the door open, please?
Thank you.
Okay.
Karev, what are you waiting for? Get on.
I-I just remembered. Dr. Hunt needs his lab results.
I'll ... I'll meet you up there.
This patient takes priori ... Karev, what ... I can do it.
No, uh, Dr. Kepner has a couple of patients in the E. R.
Go help her.
Is Dr. Webber going up? I-I need an extra hand.
He sent me.
Oh, uh, I thought you were on Dr. Shepherd's service today.
He took Cristina.
Why? I mean, why?
You don't think she's okay, do you? 'Cause I don't.
I mean, she was in the house this morning.
Did she spend the night? Because she's married.
It's a little weird for someone to ... April, don't talk about Cristina.
Just mind your own business.
I'm sorry. Um, I was just ... I was just concerned, but I will try not to be.
I swear to God, Jerry, if you don't get out of the car, I'm gonna break the glass and drag you through the freakin' window!
No!
Um, look, ma'am, this is an ambulance bay.
It's for doctor and patient vehicles only.
Well, if my idiot husband would ever get out of the car, you'd see he was a patient.
Jerry, unlock the door. Just take me home, Tess!
This was a big mistake.
Um, sir.
If there is something wrong with you, you should let us take a look.
We can help.
Really? Can you help me with these?
Uh, yes.
Yes, we can.
But we can't do anything until you get out of the car.
You'll have to open the door for me.
Okay. Um ... I need a-a chair. Oh, okay.
Oh, my ... I'm sorry.
People are great, aren't they?
Real sweethearts.
I am so, so sorry.
You will apologize to him.
Profusely.
And you will stay by his side all day ... Yes.
Even during lunch.
I don't think I'll be wanting lunch.
Yes, yes, I will.
Fine. Go get Dr. Sloan.
Decreased breath sounds on the right side.
I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.
There's a few things I don't talk about, and Cristina's one of them.
Um, so is there any chest pain or is it just difficulty breathing?
Uh, it's ... it's kinda both. It's cancer.
It's not cancer.
Ooh, it's cancer or it's, um ... Anxiety about the wedding.
Oh, when are you getting married?
Two weeks.
Well, we're gonna need to get a chest X-ray, so is there any chance that you could be pregnant?
Oh ... Mnh-mnh. Not pregnant.
You're sure?
She's sure. Mm-hmm. Really super sure.
Shut up.
I am a virgin.
Yeah. Uh, we're waiting for the wedding.
Danny's had s*x before.
It is important to him that you know that.
I didn't say anything.
Okay. They think we're freaks.
No, we don't.
No, not at all.
No, they think you're a freak, and I'm just very, very understanding.
Dr. Sloan, Dr. Bailey needs a consult in room 11-35.
I'll be right over.
Look away.
What?
Stop staring at her.
I can't.
Her last words to you were, "leave me alone,"
leave me alone, leave me alone, " only louder. Look away.
Maybe she just needs a little more time.
I'll try to look away.
Thank you.
Did it hurt?
Getting shot? Oh, you're amazing.
Well, did you feel the bullet or did you just feel pain?
I feel pain now because you won't stop talking.
And we have images.
Yeah, there it is.
Dr. Yang, what's the best approach on a tumor like this?
I don't know.
Y ... it's a pituitary tumor, so you're, uh, access would be coming in from?
You go in transnasally. Can we book an O.R. ?
What's the chance of me finishing a thought today?
Not great. Um, there's some compression, so I'd like to get in sooner than later.
Dr. Yang, can you book an O.R. , please?
You'll be scrubbing in.
You know, if she wants to do it, you know, be my guest.
Dr. Yang, book an O.R.
Fine.
Okay, that's my patient in there.
You're gonna let what's her face with the learning disability scrub in?
Why don't you just shoot the guy?
Don't talk about shooting people in this building.
Don't criticize my surgeons.
Leave your patient. Go home.
Um, Mr. Adams, sometime in your history, you contracted h. P. V.
There are various types of the virus.
This one generally causes small warts.
That allows the wartse yours, to get out of control.
We went to a dermatologist in Pullman four years ago.
They were a lot smaller then.
He removed a bunch of them, but ... they grew back.
Then we saw the guy again, and they grew back again.
They're always gonna grow back.
And that's why we should just go home.
Well, if you don't do anything about it, they're gonna continue to grow.
You'll become completely disabled.
We need to do surgery.
You can't just scrape the stuff off?
No. Um, each one of the warts has its own blood supply.
So we need to cut and Stitch each one.
So basically, I'm gonna go from looking like a tree to looking like Frankenstein, right?
Super.
Well, we'll be doing skin grafts at the same time, which will help with your appearance and function.
That said, you're right, it's not a cure.
The warts will recur, but if you schedule surgeries regularly, we might be able to keep them under control.
Do you see? It's what I told you.
They can't help.
So a couple of years with me is, what ... A waste of time?
We never go out, Jerry.
We sit in that damn house, day after day, month after month.
I want us to see a movie, to go out to dinner, I want to see ... people.
Um, if the two of you want to discuss it, we can ... No.
There's no more discussion.
You're having the surgery, 'cause if you don't, I'm gonna leave you.
And you got nobody else ... no friends, even your brothers have given up.
I'm it. I'm all that's left.
So you're having the surgery.
Hey.
Got a bronchial obstruction.
Nice.
You think it's bad if I write my own name on your board?
I mean, I did bring in the patient, and they gave me privileges.
Shepherd and Shepherd.
Classic.
What's going on?
You think I'm gonna let you do to him what you did to my mustang? I don't think so.
She's your sister. I ... you're being like this ... mm-hmm.
Because she crashed your car a couple of years ago?
I totaled my mom's car. People make mistakes.
Right. When you totaled your mother's car, were you high on pain pills?
No.
Did you steal your mother's prescription pad so you could feed your addiction?
She stole your prescription pad?
Yeah, and then when she went home, she o. D. 'Ed.
She was dead for three minutes. I saved her.
That's what she put my mother through after losing my father and raising five kids on her own, so, no, I don't trust her in my O.R. , okay?
Hey, you paged me. Is everything okay?
I have to get away from Shepherd for, like, ten minutes.
He's like the k. G. B. He's everywhere.
He's trying to help.
Yeah? Well, make him stop.
Would you love me if I wasn't a surgeon?
I would love you if you were a plumber.
But would you love you if you weren't a surgeon?
I don't know.
M-maybe.
I can't sleep when you're not there.
Then I'll be there.
Chief.
Karev.
Oh, hey.
Um, can you talk to Cristina about getting her own place?
Arizona's about to move in, and it's kinda crowded.
I mean, they want to move out.
It's just, they haven't gotten their act together.
And, uh, if I ask her about it, I'm a bitch.
But if you ask her about it, you're her best friend, inquiring about a healthy next step in her married life.
Cristina's career is hanging on by a thread.
She can't look at an O.R.
Without breaking into a cold sweat, she's a newlywed, and last night, she slept in my bed because Owen was in surgery, and she was afraid to be alone.
You really want to put her out of her house?
Did you talk to her about Cristina?
We're monsters.
A virgin ... at 27?
Yep.
Well, maybe she was waiting for the right person to come along, someone special, someone who really got her.
It's sweet. It's ... It's idealistic. It's smart is what it is.
If you don't sleep with 'em, you ... you don't get attached.
Y-you sleep with them, and then you get attached even when you don't want to, even when you specifically pick someone that you are sure that you couldn't possibly get attached, and then boom ... you're hooked.
Graspers.
Is that the mass?
Yep.
Is it a tumor?
No, it ... it looks like ... a foreign object.
All right. I got it.
What the hell is that?
A condom?
Yep.
Wait, and she aspirated it?
A condom in her lung? I'm gonna gag.
And her fiance thinks she's a virgin.
So I ... okay, here we go. Here we go.
Check it out. Ew. Ew. Ew.
Okay, now I think I'm gonna gag.
Oh, look at Grey. It looks like she's gonna heave.
She's looked like that all day.
I mean, I kinda wish I was in there.
What?
Seriously, how often does a case like this come long?
Ew. About as often as 27-year-old.
She could still be a virgin.
Just 'cause she's 27, I mean, it's ... it's not impossible.
Hey. Hey.
My wife is sleeping in your bed.
Yes, she is, with Meredith, technically.
She's sleeping with Meredith.
I'm on the other side of the bed. That ... I'm sorry. Don't you find that a little strange?
Did you see "E. T."?
The movie? Yeah. Years ago. Why?
Remember the kid ... Elliot?
Mm-hmm. - He and e. T. Had this weird and disturbing bond.
If he got sick, e. T. Got sick.
If e. T. Got drunk, Elliot would get drunk.
That's kinda like Cristina and Meredith.
Meanwhile, you and I are like the, um, the government guys in the white Hazmat suits.
You know, we're trying to steer
'em in the right direction, but in the end, we just don't understand.
And you're okay with that?
I fish. I'm building a house. I've recently taken up golf.
That helps.
I'm looking out for her.
Thank you.
So, Karev, how old were you your first time?
15. School nurse, back of her car.
15? That's impressive.
when I was 16, she taught me how to drive that same car.
Sophomore in high school, Paul Waxman, had absolutely no idea what he was doing.
Junior prom, Sarah Richardson and penny caraway, together.
I knew exactly what I was doing.
19.
19?
Mm-hmm. I was very focused on my studies.
It was my chem t. A. He was a whole head shorter than me, but ... man, he was smart.
Hey, April.
I'm not talking about this. It was a private ... private memory.
What happened, did the guy die?
Alex.
Oh, did it last, like, three seconds, so you don't know if it counted?
No.
It was on the beach at sunset. It was beautiful.
Sunset?
Yeah.
Really? Weren't ... weren't there people there?
Oh, on the beach? Man, you get sand up in places you don't want to get sand.
Mosquitoes.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ha! You're a virgin.
No, I'm not.
Oh, my God. You are!
She is.
Oh, my God. Do it. Do it. Do it to her right now.
Alex, go deflower her. Do it. Do it.
It was ... it was on the beach at sunset, okay?
Okay, leave her alone.
The beach at sunset at suis very nice.
There's a gallery upstairs. Have a seat. You can watch.
Okay, you know what, smart boy?
You can pretend like we aren't related, but we are.
And something happened to you.
What is it that you want from me, Amy?
Okay, can you imagine for a second that this is not all about you?
Two men in my family have been shot, one of them didn't survive it, and even that
I can't talk about because I was 5, and I barely remember it.
Don't make this about dad. We can't make it about anything!
You won't talk about dad.
You won't talk about this.
I'm sorry this is hard for you.
It's been hard for a lot of people.
Now I have an operation I
have to go do. Go home.
No, I'm not going anywhere. He's my patient.
I'm helping you.
I don't need help.
I have an exceedingly capable resident.
Really?
Uh, sorry I'm late. There's a long line at the cafeteria.
You're right. Crack team.
Fine. You can stay.
Dr. Bailey, how can you tell which is horn and which is finger?
If there's no bleeding, I'm still cutting off the horn.
If there's a lot of bleeding, I'm probably cutting off a finger.
Sometimes this job is very simple, Dr. Avery.
I can do that if you want.
She's fine. Right, Dr. Grey?
Right.
What?
Nothing.
Danny, uh, could you wait outside just for a couple of minutes?
Why? Is ... is everything okay? Is she ... oh, no.
Whatever you have to tell me, you can say it in front of him.
Okay. Um ... Gretchen, you've ... Oh, okay. Gretchen, wh ... uh, what ... what happened is, um ... oh.
The blockage in your lung was a condom.
Apparently, you inhaled it.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
So the good news is that we've removed it, and you should be feeling much better.
What? Danny, Danny ... wait a minute. I've ... I've ... I've waited two years, and you been having s*x with someone else? No, no, no, no.
Plenty of people use condoms to protect against sexually transmitted diseases when they're doing ... Other sorts of things.
We don't.
Danny, please! Danny, don't! Danny.
Okay, you see how I'm removing the tumor gently?
Not really.
Okay, irrigate and suction.
Good. Good. Okay. Can you see now?
Yeah, I can.
Okay. You should be able to see a little bit better now, because I'm gonna be doing ... oh, damn it. Oh, no. It's bleeding too much.
The carotid? Could be. Okay. Backing out now.
Okay, Dr. Yang, I need you to do some nasal packing, please.
Uh, no. Um, um, you can do it.
It doesn't have to be pretty. Just pack it in there.
No, I-I can't.
Yes, you can. Just do it.
No, stop, stop. Please stop it. I just ... You do it.
Pass me gelfoam and thrombin.
Give me suction.
All right. We're gonna have to open him up.
What happened to you, Karev?
Uh, patient wasn't critical, so I took the stairs.
Y-you do that all day?
Yeah. It's good exercise. What's the big deal?
Well, the big deal is, you're ... you're sweaty and you ... and you smell.
And you're not going into my O.R.
What the hell's the matter with you today? Nothing, I-I ... Karev, you stink. Now go take a shower.
What? Well, I thought I
had some normal skin here, but it's already starting to grow. What does that mean?
It means, Jerry's not going to get his skin grafts anytime soon.
He's gonna have a lot of open wounds.
So he was right.
He is gonna look like Frankenstein.
Maybe I should go update the wife.
You know, prepare her for the worst?
I mean, if ... if I were her, I would ... I would want to know sooner than later.
You're not going anywhere.
Which is fine, because I'm ... I'm fine right here.
I'm ... I'm just saying, if ... if, you know, if I were the wife, I'd want to know sooner than later.
Later it is, then.
I need my mother's engagement ring back.
Can I have it, please? Danny, please don't do this, okay?
If I could just ... she didn't cheat on you.
Yeah? She didn't.
She told us she has a friend named Jeanette who threw her a bachelorette party.
Yeah. Well, sometimes at bachelorette parties, there's a section of the party known as the tupperware segment, only it isn't really tupperware.
It's intimate items, and there's someone who shows you how to use all of these items.
So the instructor was instructing the attendees in techniques for, um, applying a certain apparatus to something that might s ... simulate a ... she put a condom on a banana with her mouth and accidentally inhaled it.
Gretchen?
I choked, okay?
And I thought that I swallowed it.
Obviously I have no idea what I'm doing.
I just wanted you to have a good time on our wedding night.
And will you please stop laughing at me?
I'm gonna love our wedding night, okay?
No matter what, I'm gonna love it, because I love you.
Stop it.
You got it?
Yep.
You sure? Because I can get it.
You know, I do this for a living.
I know. I just want to make sure you got it.
Done. Wow.
Would you look at that? I have impressed even myself.
So you're done. I can go?
I am done.
How did she get past her internship?
Shut up. Derek, come on. She's a dud.
She wasn't ready, and I pushed her.
Yeah, she wasn't ready because she's a dud.
Cristina Yang saved my life.
She saved my life.
I owe her everything.
Get out.
Get the hell out.
12 pounds.
Ebay, here I come.
Dr. Grey. I'm sorry.
You are doctors.
If you're going to be doctors, caregivers, you need to be able to handle anything the human body throws at you.
Oh! Oh, God!
Look right there. A spider. It's a spider. Oh! J ... no, no.
Come on. Somebody do something, please. It's a spider. That?
Yes! It just crawled right out of that horn.
Quick, kill it! Kill it! I ... it ... Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you. Okay. Okay. Whew.
I wouldn't have picked you ... To be a part of my life.
Professionally? Sure, if you didn't think my field was so uninteresting.
But personally?
We wouldn't have picked each other.
But now we're family.
And that means, I worry about you.
You're flaming out.
And as someone who cares about you, it's not okay.
As someone who's seen a lot of residents come and go, but very, very few with your potential ... It is not okay.
? It was really nice to meet you goodbye?
I can barely remember it ... The whole procedure.
I ... I took a bullet out of your chest, and ... and all I
can remember are ... Bits and pieces, and the bits and pieces I do remember, uh, come back at very inconvenient times so, um, end of story, okay?
Karev.
Uh, y-yes, sir.
You laid in a pool of your own blood in that elevator that's why you're taking the stairs.
Now someday you're gonna have a critical patient, and you won't be able to run up the stairs.
So ... you and I ... Are gonna take that elevator ... Right now, together.
And you're gonna stay on it until you're not scared ... You're just bored.
We're gonna have to do the surgery in stages.
We may try stretching the skin.
But right now, there's not enough normal skin to cut from, which means, we may have to revisit the idea of skin grafts later.
How much later?
That depends on how much normal skin we find.
About six months to a year.
Still, in the meantime ... He's still gonna look like a freak?
He'll look better than he did.
But there will be substantial scarring.
* I'll only lay the day *
M not even gonna get a few months where he's gonna look halfway normal, where he might want to go out, where he might want to do something besides ... Wall himself up in our house all day?
You're both just gonna have to be patient.
You met my husband, Dr. Sloan.
You really think he can do that?
I haven't touched him in four years ... Haven't kissed him, haven't held his hand.
He won't let me.
I love him so much, but ... I need to live a life, and he wants to be a hermit.
And I think ... Love isn't enough anymore.
Is that possible ... * Goodbye *
That two people can really love each other, and it just ... isn't enough?
Mr. Donaldson had a heart attack, so his arteries won't be quite as clean as mine, but you'll get the basic idea.
Now ... you opened me up.
Where did you make the incision? I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Um, when I say that I don't know, I'm not making it up.
I-I ... literally, I don't remember.
Okay. Well, fortunately, I have some details.
You started here at the sternal notch and went south 6 inches.
Okay, you know what? This is stupid. No, it isn't.
What's the worst that could happen, you kill him?
Oh, ha ha, funny.
Take the scalpel.
Median ... Sternotomy.
Good.
What happened next?
Don't worry. I'm leaving the premises.
We were in the back of the store.
Dad had just given you two pennies, and you always hid them behind the counter in this big crack in the floorboards.
You said you were saving them so you could buy a town.
And then the two guys came in.
We could hear them talking, but you weren't paying attention until dad yelled, and you looked up.
They had already pulled the gun, they had already taken the money, but now they wanted the watch that mom gave him.
He wouldn't give it up.
There was a gunshot.
You ... lunged forward.
I remember.
I was trying to get to him, but ... I couldn't move.
That's because I was holding you so tight that you couldn't budge.
I put one hand over your mouth so you wouldn't scream and wrapped the other one around you and just held on for dear life, prayed to God that you'd be quiet and you wouldn't say anything.
You were so little.
I think that's what I've always wanted all these years, is you just to stay ... Little and ... Quiet and safe.
But you're not any of those things.
You're loud and fearless, and it scares the crap out of me.
How am I supposed to call you up and tell you that I've been shot?
I can't tell you about my pain.
I don't want you to know that pain exists.
I can't believe that you keep Brandy in your locker.
A patient gave it to me. Oh, yeah?
You sneak in and take a swig every time you see a spider?
Every time I see a spider crawl out of a human limb, yes.
And it is a phobia. Mm-hmm.
Okay? It is not ... hey. Give me back my bottle.
Oh, no, no, no, Teddy needs it.
She's pathetic. That's right.
Mm-hmm. You finish it, I'll hurt you.
We're gonna live in a frat house forever, aren't we?
Hey, no. Meredith's is a frat house.
Our place is just that off-campus apartment where the burnouts go to buy pot.
Did you tell him good-bye?
I've kinda been avoiding him.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start to cry, and then he'll think I'm some kind of crazy stalker.
Uh, let's go buy Bailey a real drink.
Yeah. Yeah, let's go do that.
Excuse us.
Hi. Hi.
Hey.
You gonna have dinner with me?
Maybe we should just settle for a peck on the cheek and a wave good-bye and keep it simple.
Yeah, that sounds, uh ... Incredibly ... dissatisfying.
I like you more than I wanted to.
And, uh ... And I knew what this was.
I don't know what my problem is.
Well, I've got a couple of thoughts about that.
I thought I was the one person that you weren't gonna analyze.
Well, I'm not entirely sure it requires a professional.
I mean, either I'm wildly attractive, and your formidable reason is no match for my ... Incredible magnetism.
Or ... you, uh, fall for men who aren't available ... engaged ... Or only in town for a few weeks.
You're making some lousy choices, Altman.
You deserve a little more.
Nobody chooses to be a freak.
Most people don't even realize they're a freak until it's way too late to change it.
Come on. Just admit it. You're still a virgin.
No, I'm not. Hey, there's no shame in it.
Really? No, there's shame.
A lot of shame. Tell her, mer. I, um ... I was gonna say something, and then I forgot to stop drinking.
Has anybody seen Cristina?
Okay. So today only one person looked at me like a psycho who might run down the hall naked, and Dr. Bailey screamed like a little bitch baby over a spider, so I'm feeling pretty good, you know, for a crazy person.
Well, nobody gives a crap if you're crazy. We're all crazy.
Yeah, look at April. She's still a virgin.
Yeah, well, Mark gives a crap, okay?
He stares at me like I'm a menace to myself and everyone around me.
Wait. You're still a virgin? What? Stop. Okay?
Just stop.
I'm a virgin. Yes. So what?
It's not something I talk about, okay?
We all have things we don't talk about.
Alex, you've been afraid of the elevator for, like, a month, but I never said anything because it's none of my business.
And, Jackson, you wake up every night screaming because you have nightmares. And, Meredith, you don't talk about Cristina because you're afraid she's never gonna be the same Cristina again.
And, Lexie ... for God sake, Mark never thought you were a psycho. He loves you.
That's why he stares at you, because he can't keep his eyes off the woman he loves.
Of course, he's never gonna say anything 'cause he doesn't feel like he can.
Look, we all have stuff we don't talk about.
I am a 28-year-old virgin, mainly because
I wanted my first time to be special, and then I waited too long, and partially because
I'm pretty sure guys find me annoying.
I'm a virgin. That doesn't make it drinks conversation.
We all have stuff we don't talk about.
Oh, April. I'm liking you more and more.
Thank you.
You're not on call tonight?
No. No, I'm home all night.
Good.
How was your day?
I think ... I could be happy being a plumber.
I ... whoa.
We have to get our own place. Yeah.
But no matter how much of a freak you end up being ... Chances are, there's still someone out there for you.
Unless, of course, they've already moved on ... So what time do you have to be at the airport?
Not for another couple of hours.
Because when it comes to love ... Even freaks can't wait forever.Oh. We become territorial.
Towel.
Oh.
ow! Oh, sorry.
Jeez. Sorry.
Yeah.
* we could *
You know this isn't normal?
We learn to compete.
yo, Torres.
Oh, shoot. I told him I'd work out this morning.
But this is like working out. It's just more fun.
Come on. No pain, no gain. Go away, Mark!
What? Hey, be nice. He's lonely.
Did you just say my ... oh! Oh!
Right. Nice.
You finish. I'll wait.
*
* we don't have to be honest *
We seek shelter.
Take a look at some of the fine details up here.
It was built around the turn of the century. Wait. These are the original doors?
You bet.
Wait till you see the upstairs.
Antique hardware on those windows.
That's a cool fireplace.
You know, it's really a lot of space.
If we knock through this wall, We'd get all that light to flood through.
Hey, you like the, uh, the firemen's pole?
Mm.
Okay. Um, this could be our house.
I kinda need you to care.
* hiding *
We'll think about it.
Most important of all? We reproduce.
I drank a lot of tequila in college ... After. Well, it's been a while since I've done my o. B. Rotations, But I don't recall tequila
Getting in the way of conception.
It's the opposite, actually.
I ... Could have, uh, endometriosis or adhesions or ... Look, she's gonna come in here, And she's gonna say everything's fine.
sometimes biology can turn on us, though.
So ... We have a few things to discuss here.
* ah, ah, ah *
Yeah, Biology sucks sometimes.
"hostile"?
Did she really call my uterus hostile?
are you forgetting what she said after that? What, about my hostile uterus
Causing me to miscarry the first time, Or the likelihood that it'll happen again? But there is a treatment. She said ... Hostile. Well, you're just getting stuck on a word.
How would you feel
If she called your pen1s "angry" or "snide"? That's a good point, But the important thing is that you're healthy.
Just think of all the fun we're gonna have trying now.
I'm late for rounds.
you paged?
Did you know that bariatric centers are
Some of the leading moneymakers
In hospitals right now, Dr. Bailey?
I have rounds, sir. And that's interesting, Considering that Seattle grace doesn't have one.
And do you know why we don't have one, Dr. Bailey?
Space, Dr. Bailey. We don't have enough space.
Oh, oh, chief, okay, If you go anywhere near
My denny duquette memorial clinic, You will come to work tomorrow and find me and every nurse who loves me chained to its doors.
We need money, Bailey.
Ever since the shooting, we've been in survival mode
When we need to be in fight mode, Groundbreaking surgery mode, back-to-number-one-ranking mode.
It's my turn to have Cristina Yang on my service.
That's all the fight I have in me today.
Hostile uterus.
Mm. House hunting with my husband.
At least it's not cancer.
At least you're calling him your husband.
Oh. Baby steps. Whatev.
Hey, uh, do you know how long
April and Jackson are planning to stay in the house? Uh, as long as they like. Why?
Well, April's taken over Izzie's room, Which was fine when it was temporary, But I live in the attic, And I sleep next to christmas ornaments. Hmm.
April's best friend just died, and she's all alone.
I'm not evil. It's just ... She's annoying.
Okay? I find her annoying.
Really? I find you much more annoying.
Car ran into a laundromat. Multiple traumas!
I'm not wrong.
Mm.
Pretty annoying.
You coming?
Baby steps don't include multiple traumas.
You go kill it.
ooh, hi.
You need to start sleeping with Mark again.
I do? Yeah, for my sake, you do.
He won't leave us alone.
At the apartment, at ... at work, I mean, in our bedroom ... It's like I'm dating Mark against my will.
Come on. Twice a week. That's all I'm asking. I am not babysitting Mark for you.
Besides, I am too tired for s*x with anyone right w.
I was up all night dictating charts again. Well, you know, there's a thing called a resident
That can do that for you. Yeah, and my resident is avery.
He still knocking over trays in the o. R. ? Yes, And scribbling patient orders in his thi-grade scrawl and paging me in the middle of the night
For patients who are nowhere near dying. At least he's nice to look at.
True.
Thank you.
You just got called a dumb blond.
Can you find out about my husband? His name's larry.
He was in the car with you?
No, he was in the laundromat. I- I hit him.
I don't remember anything.
I was in the car outside the laundromat, And the next thing I know, the car's inside the laundromat, And there was screaming. okay.
do you want to order her labs or take her scans?
You can take her. Take it all, taker.
What? Lost vitals in the ambulance bay.
Get me epi and charge the defibrillator now.
larry. That's him! That-
that's my husband.
That's ... Is he gonna be okay?
I cannot go out this way.
I- I can't die in a freak laundromat accident.
Ow!
Sorry.
You cannot find anything wrong.
I'm supposed to go to brazil next week.
rio.
And I just perfected my accent.
Voce tem uma camisinha?
I'm ... Fine. How are you?
Nope. I just asked you if you had a condom.
'cause that's the one sentence I learn
Before traveling someplace now.
Yeah. Now you totally think I'm a slut.
Oh, I don't. Um ... Take a breath for me, please.
It totally makes you think I'm a slut
Until I tell you I have huntington's disease.
Yeah, you're not gonna find it on the chart.
The paramedic was so cute, So I just didn't mention anything, Because, you know, the whole fatal genetic coition, It just doesn't scream "sexy."
Have you started showing symptoms?
No.
My, uh, my mother died, So I got tested for the gene.
She was 45, so I have about 10 years left.
Or five if you count the ones I can actually enjoy.
Well, the accident shouldn't affect your huntington's.
I know that. I'm just telling you
So that you get that you have to work really hard to fix me, Because I can live with the fact that I'm gonna die, But to die doing laundry? No.
I want to accidentally fall off the eiffel tower
Because the three men and the multiple orgasms
Were too much.
You should've seen it, Dr. Robbins.
His pottaballet kicked the other kids' asses.
It's pas de bourrée, dad. Isn't that what I said?
You said it in american, fred. It's french, right, sweetie?
Yes, and it's not something that you really kick ass at.
Can we talk about the cancer now?
Anything to make them stop.
Yeah. Um, Dr. Karev?
Jake fisher, 15, uh, osteosarcoma of the right tibia.
Today he'll be getting a minor bone dissection.
How long after the surgery before I can dance again?
He's anxious 'cause his ballet company
Is doing "swan lake" this spring.
Yeah, it's like his super bowl.
Jake, your recovery will depend on today's scans.
They'll tell us how much the chemo shrunk the tumor, But trust me, we will have you back on your feet
As soon as possible, okay?
Okay, can you tell me when the pain started, Mr. Fink? A - a few days ago.
I'm a biologist. I'm in the middle of an experiment.
Pan.
Okay.
Oh.
Stop! Don't take that anywhere.
That could be research lost.
Sir, you're very sick.
You need to put aside your work for the moment.
It's not just work. It's a cure for asthma.
What? Dr. Bailey.
Just get rid of the vomit, Yang.
I- I don't think you want me to do that.
There's my cure.
Isn't he beautiful?
Research has found, Rms produce an enzyme that cut down on allergies.
I'm applying the theory to asthma.
You eat worms?
Yang. How long do these experiments last?
Mm. Standard is a month or two.
And then I take the antiparasitic to pass them.
But I can extract more enzyme the longer I grow them.
A year is pushing it, apparently.
You've had these worms inside of you for a year?
343 days to be exact.
Haven't had an asthma attack in six months.
Dr. Bailey.
My, they've grown.
You have a nasty bowel obstruction, Mr. Fink.
You need surgery.
Oh, no. That won't do.
Surgery will throw off the entire experiment.
I'd like another option. Sir. Okay, I'm sorry, but ... It's three years research, Dr. Bailey.
Research you'd be contaminating the minute you cut me open.
Okay, Dr. Yang's gonna give you fluid and put an n. G. Tube down your nose
To open the obstruction.
It will be painful, and if you dot improve in a few hours, You're getting the surgery.
Option two it is then.
You know he's crazy, right?
Crazy is relative, Yang.
In fact, some people might say
That missing rounds this morning
When I'm charge is crazy behavior, too.
But here I am, trusting you to take care of my patient.
Maybe I'm the crazy one. What do you think?
Am I crazy to trust you to take care of my patient?
No.
But I haven't been swallowing worms.
well, his pain is not too bad.
That means his tumor probably shrunk, right?
If the chemo did its job. Guess who just scored a table
At that new sushi place that's impossible to get in to?
no way. 8:30, table for 3.
Oh, you know, I don't ... I don't eat sushi.
Yeah, you do. Yeah, I did.
I did, but then I
got sick after I ate
One of those prepackaged rolls at the cafeteria.
Bad memory. you two go.
I'll change the reservation to two.
What?
Mm ... Torres, you should see this.
god.
I hate this job sometimes.
Lila, your c. T. Shows that you have a ruptured diaphragm, So you're gonna need surgery.
So how will we proceed, Dr. Avery?
Part of your stomach's gone into your chest.
So we'll place your stomach back
Anrepair the diaphragm with mesh.
Dr. Grey, do you agree?
No, I would do a direct repair with suture instead of mesh
Because the defect is so small.
That's right.
All right, Dr. Grey, draw pre-op labs.
You're scrubbing in.
Lila, do you need us to call anyone for you?
No. It's just me.
But I would like it if he would wait by my bedside.
Yeah, you and every other woman in this hospital.
All right. I'll see you in the o. R.
Thank you.
Oh, please tell me you've gotten to make out with that.
No. Married, so no.
That's a bummer.
Any babies?
Uh, no, but thinking about it.
Um, did you need me to scrub in, ?
The question should be "may I scrub in? "
Like you want to.
Right. It's may ... may I.
No, I think I've got all the hands I need.
Dr. Altman ... I know.
Okay, I've been f my game lately, And you've suffered because of it.
But right now, I need you to give me another chance.
Okay? Please.
I ... Look, I want to scrub in, okay?
Okay. Yeah.
Just, um ... Okay. okay.
Mrs. Davis' scans are clean?
Yeah, so is her ultrasound. I think we should do an e. E. G.
Really? Do you think that's really ... She lost control of her parked car, Has no memory of how, so I think that's necessary, But you outrank me, so ... whatever.
Well, sure, fine. Let's do it.
Um ... Hey, how would you feel
If I started a chore wheel at the house?
The boys are so messy, And I did one with reed at our old apartment, And you'd be surprised how well it works.
Are you moving in, like, permanently?
Why? Do ... do you think that's not okay?
should I talk to Meredith about that? Well, that's up to you, But I wouldn't bring up the chore wheel.
Meredith would hate that.
Hey, how's our reckless driver?
Uh, she's not reckless.
She may have had syncope or a seizure ... hey, mer.
Lexie and I were just talking about the housing situation ... If this is about Izzie's room ... no. No, no, no, it's not about Izzie's room.
It's about a chore wheel.
April would like to start one.
That's a great idea.
What? Great. I'll, uh, I'll set it up tonight.
Great. Hey, um ... how'd it go this morning?
Eh. what happened this morning?
but you're okay, right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Why wouldn't you be fine? Nothing. I have to go.
Wh ... what was this morning?
You should talk to Meredith.
What are they saying?
Are they saying the chemo didn'tork?
We should wait for your parents.
Oh, my god.
You want to cut off my leg?
Oh, my god.
Uh, look ... There's a sprinter with prosthetics
That runs faster than guys with real legs. There's gotta be another way. More ... more chemo or ... Yeah, but with prosthetics day, it's ... it's amazing.
You don't get it! I need my leg!
I get it.
No, you don't.
It's ... I ... I- I can't explain it.
I, um ... Just ... I'll show you.
L- let me show you.
* baby, you *
* you got what I need *
If he gets injured, this is on you, Karev.
* you got my sunshine *
* baby, you *
* you got what I need *
* you got my sunshine *
* ooh *
* when I see you *
* it's a ... *
* beautiful world *
* but when you're gone *
* ooh *
* I want you in my arms *
* it's all I can dream of *
* baby, you *
* you got what I need *
* baby, you *
* you got my sunshine *
* ooh *
* baby, you *
* you got what I need *
You see that?
That's my boy.
* baby, you *
* you got my sunshine *
It's that ... Right there.
Build me a leg that'll let me do that.
*
She called it hostile?
That's ... Well, at least it's nothing too serious.
I'll do some research on treatment options.
Her uterus is friendly.
It's sunshiny.
untouched by scourge of man.
Peppy ovaries, too.
Hey, the vending machine's working again.
What?
* I've been quiet nearly all my life *
Nothing. Is this the same nothing that has to do
With where you were this morning?
I was at the dentist this morning. I have bad teeth.
Oh, okay, so "teeth"
are code for what?
I went to the o. B. Today.
I have massive, baby-squishing fibroids in my uterus.
Oh, that's terrible.
Eh, get over it.
But you knew? Knew what?
Nothing. The vending machine's working again.
my patient eats worms. Dude, altman fire you yet?
She is not gonna fire me. What'd you do?
She thin he's a hot piece of brainless ass.
Oh, you're totally gonna be fired.
The situation is under control. Thank you.
You got a line on any weird bone cancer treatments
So I don't have to cut off my ballerina kid's leg? Right, 'cause my memory is all I'm good for?
There was a story in the news recently
Ere they used a cadaver bone to replace a cancerous one.
You get my fries. Ooh.
*
You paged?
Yeah, Dr. Knox's sister just put her house on the market.
They just redid it. It's close to Meredith's house, And it has never been a fire station, right?
You paged me to talk real estate?
W ... that and I thought you might want to observe.
Our guy, he got caught between a car and washing machine, And you don't see that kind of crush injury every day, But no pressure.
Thank you, but I have to monitor worms.
a rotationplasty?
No, no, it's not possible with this part of the leg.
Fibular grafting?
Oh, no. Cancer's seeded to his fibula.
* do, do, do, and we do ... *
What?
You don't like Mark. Admit it.
I like Mark. Liar.
I like him. I do.
We're just, you know ... We're different. oh, my god.
How are you different?
Tell me, 'cause I don't-
I don't think you actually are.
Mnh-mnh. What?
Should I leave? Shut it, Karev. I'm waiting.
* whatever we want to do *
Look ... It's not that I don't like Mark. Mm-hmm.
It's just that he's ... Mark.
You know, what you see is what you get.
Besides, you like him, So what do I care if his abs are where his soul should be?
oh, my god.
Found it!
Found it right here.
We don't have to cut off his leg.
Page Dr. Bailey and book an o. R.
Mm-hmm. Surgery? No, please.
Can't we wait just a little longer?
Your bowel could perforate and fill your abdomen
With fecal matter, so, no, we cannot wait.
Can you at least salvage the worms during the surgery?
Your life is at risk because of a hypothesis you can't support.
Otherwise, you would have the backing
Of an actual accredited institute, So let the worms go.
I worked in those institutes my whole life.
I sat in labs, Ran other people's experiments.
I was dead inside.
And now for the first time, I know what I'm meant to do with my life, And everything else-
all my quirks, my fears, The fact that people find me strange ... None of it matters because I know who I am.
Please.
Save the worms.
Let's get him prepped.
"stroke, infection, Heart attack, severe bleeding, loss of life"?
Oh, what the hell?
When did the chorea start?
Chorea? I call that my spastic hand trick.
A few months ago, I guess.
You told your doctors? They know, right?
Lila.
I ... no guilt trip, please.
I was just starting to like you.
But you need to tell your doctors, Because they can help you.
I watched my mother go through this, Dr. Grey.
I- I know how this goes.
After the spastic hand comes the slurred speech, And then the trouble walking, and the difficulty eating, And the seizures, and the memory loss, And then the dementia sets in so badly
That you d't know if you're in the supermarket Or the bathroom.
o screw going to the freakin' doctor.
I am going to brazil.
Ah, Dr. Grey.
I can use your input.
Do you think Derek would nsider
Putting his face on a billboard? Oh. That's a lot of Derek.
Pretty good picture, right?
Mm-hmm.
What do you need?
When my mother was still here
Before she retired ... Do you think that she ever tried to tell you
About the alzheimer's?
No, no.
She kept it a secret for years.
No, I know that, but ... Um, when do you think it started?
Do you think she was trying to tell you, and you didn't
Really realize that's what she was trying to do, was tell you?
Well, it's possible, I guess.
Uh, and I don't remember ... Is eveing okay, Meredith?
Yeah, it's fine. Just ... I would never go to a hospital
That put its doctors on billboards, For what it's worth.
His b. P. Has dropped to 90 over 60, And he's showing signs of peritonitis.
Good work, Yang. You're free to scrub in if you like, Uh, even just to observe.
No one's gonna make you do anything you don't want.
I'm not ready.
Thank you, though, for asking.
Okay, so we'll take out the bone, and then treat it
With high doses of radiation to kill the cancer.
30 minutes later, we reinsert the bone back into jake's leg.
Usually the procedure is done using a cadaver bone, So there's no risk of putting cancer back in the body, But we couldn't find a match for jake on such short notice.
So there's a chance the cancer could come back? Well, that's why amputation's less risky.
But if we do this, if you agree, We will monitor jake closely, scans every few months, And if the cancer returns, we'll do the amputation.
But this is done a lot?
Uh, it's only been done a few times in the world.
So if we do this, I mean, if we say yes, There's a chance he'd keep his leg forever?
We hope.
It's a big risk, buddy.
God knows, I love to watch you dance, but ... What would you do?
Oh, that's ... that's between you and your folks, jake.
no.
I want to know.
What would you do?
If it was my arm, and, uh, I couldn't operate anymore, I ... I'd do everything that I could to keep it.
well, we've run an e. K. G. , c. T. , And done blood work.
Fortunately, they've all come back normal.
You mean unfortunately.
They'rwaiting to take my statement.
Well, it was just an accident, Mrs. Davis.
You probably just pressed the wrong pedal.
Oh, tell that to them.
They throw people in jail all the time
For this sort of thing.
There is another test we can run. what?
It's called a tilt test.
It can tell us if you fainted before the accident.
We'll schedule it right away.
did you get approval for a tilt test?
No. Okay, well, I hate to pull rank here, But I am a year ahead of you ... we're at work, April, there's no chore wheel.
If I want to run a tilt test, I'm gonna run a tilt test.
I'd throw a party.
Fly everyone to an amazing beach, All expenses paid.
I mean, I'd have to max oumy credit cards
In order to pay for it, but what do I care?
I wouldn't be around to have to pay it off. Suction.
I'd do what lila did. I'd quit, sell the house, And bum around the globe. And how would Derek feel about that?
Ah, he could come along if he wanted.
There's something sad about that, though.
Wandering around, living in hotels ... That's ... that's not a life.
This, though, even if I
was gonna die tomorrow, I'd still want to do it.
Can I try the diaphragm repair?
What?
The repair, can I ... Can I try it?
Uh, n ... uh, no, no, you can't.
I'm ... I'm good, though. Thank you.
Oh, he's hypertensive. Get his pressure back up.
Okay, get some saline in here quick. Clamp.
I need more irrigation in here now. right away.
Dr. Bailey, what's wrong?
He's perforated.
I have to evacuate this abscess. Suction.
suction. Can't you just use antibiotics?
If I want to risk losing him.
He needs his worms back for his research.
The suction will destroy them.
Look, I'm concerned about his life right now, Dr. Yang, Not his research. Suction.
you did really good with ts kid today, Karev.
Impressive, which is funny, 'cause I wouldn't think
That you'd be good in peds just by looking at you.
Okay, fine. I don't like Mark ... At all.
There. I said it.
'cause you never even tried. Ugh.
Take jake here. You think his dad was happy
When jake wanted ballet shoes for christmas and not cleats?
No, this guy wanted a kid he could throw a ball with, You know he did, but his son loved to dance, So he signed him up for lessons, went to recitals, Learned what there was to love about ballet.
He tried ... Because he loved his kid.
Mark stares at my boobs when we talk.
He starts with my face, but then somewhere along the way, He gets distracted and ends up on my boobs.
And I love guys. I love them.
But I have tried my whole life to avoid the boob-staring guy.
Biology even helped me by making me gay.
But now my girlfriend's bestend is that guy.
And I don't think that I need to apologize for the fact
That the only person I want staring at my boobs is you. Boobs, really?
You're making this about boobs? He stares at them.
'cause they're good boobs. Can I leave now?
Yes. Go. Hurry.
So we had to remove his spleen and a kidney, But I expect a full recovery.
And the girl that was inside?
Uh, she's out of surgery now. She's doing great.
Oh, thank god. and as for your tests, You're in tip-top shape, Mrs. Davis.
I'll talk to the police, Um, tell them to come back tomorrow
So you can have some time alone with your husband.
He's not my husband anymore.
What?
Larry left me three months ago.
He said he needed time to himself to think.
A week later, I find out he's living with someone else.
Her name's kimmy.
She sings in the choir at our church.
Kimmy.
It's a ridiculous name, right?
This morning, I'm on my way to the post office ... When I see his car outside the laundromat.
38 years of marriage, And not once did he pick up a bottle of detergent.
So I pulled over.
he was inside
Folding a pair of ... Hot pink panties ... Doing her laundry.
She wasn't even there!
The next thing I know, My car's inside the laundromat.
I feel badly ... For that ... Poor innocent girl I hit.
I'm ... I'm glad she's okay.
But ... I know now why they call it the green-eyed monster.
Mrs. Davis, I-I think that, um ... No, it's awful to unload on you. I know. I know.
But I figured you're used to it.
People must tell you their secrets all the time
Because of the doctor-patient confidentiality law, right?
That only applies to medicine.
No, no.
You are required to keep my secrets.
no, ma'am.
That's lawyers.
Dr. Avery, I need you to ... Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry. I'll come back.
No, no, no, please. It's, uh, it's cool.
What do you need?
Right.
I wasn't sure if I was making up stuff in my head, But ... Now I know.
* if there was a chance *
* that we could be lovers *
I'm doing a cabg. How do I start?
Wait, what?
I'm doing a cabg tomorrow.
You want to scrub in, so tell me how I start. Go.
Um, divide the sternum, open the thymus, Incise the pericardium, Then take down the mammary artery with the cautery ... Bypass has started. Now what?
Cross-clamp the aorta, Instill antegrade cardioplegia, Followed by retrograde-
now I want to take him off bypass.
Rewarm, check the flow of grafts, vent the root ... That's enough.
Good. I'm relieved.
You're actually more than the pretty face
You make yourself out to be.
You knocked over a tray in my o. R. , You get the answer wrong sometimes, Your penmanship needs work.
None of these are fireable offenses.
But flirting? Flirting into my surgery, Batting your eyes while I'm inside a chest cavity?
I should go to the chief and have you fired right now.
I'm not gonna do that this time.
Now put your shirt on and take care of these post-ops.
* 'cause I want *
* to believe *
There you are. I've been paging you.
Oh, my patient needs his worms. I'm trying to save 'em.
Ooh.
A head.
What's going on?
Oh, I, uh, need you to take my blood.
For what?
So I can get tested for the alzheimer's gene.
* stay with me *
I mean, it's time I know one way or the other, right?
I have a hostile uterus.
What's a little alzheimer's, too?
Okay.
This is a lot bigger than a baby step.
Just do it before I change my mind.
okay.
* until the last falling star *
You're still here?
I had to drop these off before I left.
It's medication for your hand, But you will have to see your doctor and get it refilled
When you get back from your trip.
They can help you, lila. I'll go. Promise.
oh, come on.
I said I'll go. No guilt trip, please.
* join the waves *
Biology says that we are who we are from birth, That our d. N. A. Is set in stone, Unchangeable.
There was a complication, But we were able to take care of it in surgery.
You're gonna be fine as long as you quit the worms.
I understand.
* now I'm *
* falling on my knees *
* and tumblin' down *
* I'm tumblin' *
* I'm tumblin', I'm tumblin' *
The surgery destroyed them all.
I'm sorry.
* I'm tumblin' *
I'm sorry.
* I'm tumblin', I'm tumblin down *
Well ... Every experiment has its ups and downs.
* it's like my early morning sunset *
How much time would you think
Before my bowel is completely healed?
No, if you do this again, you could die.
Do you understand that? Only if I make the same mistakes.
I won't.
Decrease the quantity, shorten the time frame ... No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Why would you
Want to put yourself through this again?
* questions till I fall *
because I love what I do ... More than anything.
* or let my soul fade away *
* in the dark *
You don't find something you love that much and let it go.
You hold on to it, throw yourself in deeper.
Our d. N. A doesn't account for all of us, though.
We're human.
Life changes us.
Post-ops are stable, And I've ordered morning labs.
Mm. Thanks.
You know, Sloan risked his life to save mine, Even when I was sleeping with his girl.
That's not a guy without a soul.
Maybe he's an ass who stares at boobs, but whatever.
And your boobs, you ... you have nice boobs.
maybe they're lesbian boobs, And you don't like men staring at them, But men don't discriminate when it comes to jugs.
You have hot boobs, and I stare at 'em, too.
We develop new traits ...
I was ... I was in the driver's seat of the car ... Become less territorial.
Hey, so reckless driver
Turned out to be a psycho killer?
Failed psycho killer, thank god.
She was heartbroken, okay?
Her husband left her for a younger version of herself.
She's just ... Lexie ... No, you know what?
I have been a total bitch to April all day because of you.
You know that? What?
I'm j ... I'm gonna go. I ... April, just ... Stay.
You worry about April, you let her have Izzie's room, You talk to her about your doctor's appointments.
And I went crazy, Alex ditched me in a psych ward, Mark slept with Derek's sister, And now I find myself ... Relating to thazy, jealous lady
Who drives into laundromats.
April, you should go.
lexie ... I ... Had a miscarriage that day.
April was there.
That's why she knows about my doctor's appointment.
And I did know that Mark slept with amy, But I didn't think you cared.
I can never tell what the ll is going on with you two.
And as far as the psych ward goes, You were not alone.
I sat by your bedside for
36 hours while you slept.
You're not crazy, lexie.
You're a Grey.
We stop competing.
Change of plans.
Mark, you're taking me to dinner tonight. What?
We're going on a date, you and I, alone.
Is this to make up for the fact that you don't like me?
Mm. You told him?
No, I ... she didn't need to.
Fine.
Let's go, but you are buying.
Thank you.
You, uh, you still want italian?
Mm. Eyes on my face, Mark.
We learn from our mistakes.
Just ... boys out. Hey ... Go. Just ... Take the towel ... All right.
And go.
Hey, seriously, if you want the room ... I admitted that I wanted to drive my car over you ... so taking the room would just make me feel worse.
okay. But if you put up a freakin' chore wheel, I'll kill you.
We face our greatest fears.
Hi.
Mm.
Hi.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
What?
Um ... I am ... Getting tested for the alzheimer's gene.
Oh. No.
I should know. We should know.
No.
My uterus is hostile.
We probably can't even have a baby.
And even if we could, My brain is probably full of alzheimer's, So I wouldn't even remember the baby's name.
Or even worse, I'll pass the alzheimer's on to the baby.
Then you'd have an
80-year-old drooling wife and a 50-year-old drooling kid.
I don't care.
Derek ... Listen, I love you, and you love me.
And ... Whatever happens ... I don't care. I don't want to know.
I mean it. I don't want to know.
Well, the lab already has my blood, so ... Okay, so here's what we're gonna do ... No more doctors, no more labs, And you and we have a lot of se.
Maybe we can make a baby, maybe not.
Maybe you get alzheimer's, maybe not.
But just ... Screw the odds, screw the science.
Let's just live.
Whatever happens ... Happens.
Me and you ... Okay?
* I'm telling you *
Okay.
Okay.
For better or worse, We find ways to become more than our biology.
The risk, of course ...
Cristina?
* so much love *
Cristina.
* but we need so much more *
Is that we can change too much ...
Welcome home.
to the point, we don't recognize ourselves.
It's ours. We bought it.
Well, I bought it, but, uh, it's for the both of us.
Finding our way back can be difficult.
There's no compass, no map.
I don't know what to say.
Our house has a fire pole in it.
What else is there to say?
you said this morning ... I don't care where we live.
I really don't, but you do.
You love this place.
And I love you.
We just have to close our eyes, Take a step, And hope to god we'll get there.
* so much love *
* but we need so much more *they train doctors slowly. They watch us practice on frogs ... And pigs, and dead people, And then live people. They drill us relentlessly. They raise us like children. And eventually, they take a cold, hard boot, And they kick us out of the nest.
I have great faith in you ... Great faith.
I can because I chose you, I trained you.
I've watched you work. I know what you can do.
That's why today is different.
The training wheels are coming off, people.
I'm throwing down the gauntlet today, people.
I've got a $1-million surplus and one department gets it.
You know what you need, and I know what you need.
Now I want to know what you want.
And I'm gonna keep the residents busy, very busy.
So that'll give you time to put your best foot forward.
Navy scrubs? Attending scrubs.
You are attendings today.
Run the cases, take point, but don't be a fool.
If you get in over your head, cry uncle.
Until then ... Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.
Um, chief webber.
Uh, sorry. I-I didn't get any scrubs.
Oh, this is for fourth-year residents only, Grey.
It's just a regular day for you.
Well, fine.
Well, if they're gonna be attendings, Then that makes me chief resident.
No. That makes you our scut monkey.
No, it doesn't. Does ... does it?
It doesn't.
* why you been stallin', stallin all the time *
* it's true, why do you lie? *
* I don't know who you're seein' on the sly *
* today I got to know *
* who you been calling, calling, did you slide? *
The attendings aren't going anywhere.
We're basically just playing dress up.
Yeah.
*
Here you go. Thank you.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Of course it is. We all did it.
It's the evolution of the craft, the passing of the torch, The lifeblood of the training process.
mm.
Here you go.
Here you go. Thanks. Hey. Come on.
Ow.
Pray, people.
We want god in the building today.
What time are we pitching you? Yeah, is there an order?
You people are adults. You decide the order.
I decide whose department gets the $1 million.
Love a good dogfight.
He can be intimidating once you get in the room.
Really? Oh, yeah.
When I pitched my cartilage research last year, he was
All ticked off 'cause I had a typo in my table of contents.
Y
you had a table of contents? Yeah.
What? I love a good dogfight, too.
ruff.
it's my case.
Are you gonna hand me over the chart?
What factors would lead a patient
To want breast reduction surgery?
Uh, neck pain, back pain, balance issues.
Hand it over. Keep trying.
I don't know. Maybe she's a prude, Uh, doesn't want everyone staring at her all the time.
Maybe she's embarrassed. No, but you're getting warmer.
Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
Mindy gruberman. Nice to meet you.
I can work with that.
she's not the patient. Dr. Robbins.
So you'll be on my service, too, huh?
Dr. Karev's gonna be our team leader today.
Excuse me. Honey.
quit futzing with the gown. Come out here.
The doctors want to see you. come here.
What's up?
Ms. Radigan, you're still having these headaches and ringing in the ears?
All day long. It's driving me crazy.
It's caused by a buildup of fluid in your skull.
So what we will do is insert a shunt, And that will relieve the pressure on your brain. What do you mean,"we"?
You're doing the actual tube part in the brain, right, N
not them? Excuse her. She's a schoolteacher.
She talks to everyone like they're hiding gum
Behind their back. that's all right. She can ask questions.
Dr. Grey and Dr. Avery are residents.
They're very talented. One of them will be
Performing the procedure, and I will be observing.
A trainee cutting into ellie's brain? No.
I know it sounds like a leap, But these doctors study and assist for years.
At some point, we have to let them operate.
That's how we make new surgeons. Let them learn on someone else.
Who, someone who's too scared to interrogate the doctors?
They have to learn on someone. Might as well be an old lady.
You're my old lady. This should be my call.
I won't let them move a muscle
Without my direction and approval. You're a teacher, joanne.
Let the kids learn.
She's my life. She has been my life for 40 years.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
radiologist, contact 5-3-1-0.
Radiologist ...
Who gets to cut?
I want to get a look at both of you with a drill
Before I decide who gets the shunt.
Skills lab seems like a fair way to go.
Competing with the wife? Like that's not a stacked deck. Well, it's a game, really.
So all you have to do is win, which you won't. I don't like the idea
Of teenagers getting plastic surgery. If the growths were on his face, You wouldn't have a problem with him wanting them removed. Yeah, but I might have a problem
With Karev removing them.
I'll give you that.
Ooh. What happened?
Karev's about to do a gynecomastia surgery
On a 13 year old.
Oh, Karev's fine. He's done way bigger procedures than that.
You two would just rather worry about him than about
Your, uh, presentations to the chief. Oh, yeah. I'm not worried.
The money is going to the tiny humans.
No one ever says no to the tiny humans. Oh. Okay.
What?
Well ... You're not gonna cry
'cause you find the chief intimidating?
no. Good. good.
All right. I have work to do.
Okay.
Yeah.
Bye.
what, are you trying to psych her out?
Ortho needs the money. She and the friggin' tiny humans
Have all the help they need already.
I'm getting the money. Let it go.
oh, okay.
why wouldn't I?
Well, because you never prepare for anything.
You think you'll get by on your good looks and charm and the brilliance that pops off the top of your head.
Yeah, 'cause it always works.
mm. Uh-huh.
Roy henley, 57, was admitted 2 days ago
With severe wheezing from pulmonary hypertension, Which basically means ... I can't breathe for crap.
We're gonna run some tests.
That should help us decide how to proceed.
You can run all the tests you want, But what I need's new lungs.
My doctor said I was gonna need 'em one day, But I was too healthy for it.
I bet I'm not too healthy now.
Dr. Yang?
We'll run some tests.
Uh, Mr. Henley, You listed your daughter as your emergency contact.
Is she here with you today?
Oh, no. She lives over in aberdeen.
I don't want to trouble her. Is there anyone here with you?
I'm a tough old dog. I don't need a chaperone.
Sir, your ... your condition is serious.
It might be time to trouble your daughter.
Do we think he's a transplant candidate?
Do we? Well, at this point, I don't think there's anything else we can do, right?
Dr. Yang, do you agree?
I don't know.
You don't know if you agree?
He'd have to be approved by the transplant team before
Going on the waiting list. Do we convene a panel?
Yang, do we? I couldn't say.
he's running out of time.
I say we convene the panel for today.
Okay, convene the panel, and then what?
I get some interns to order Mr. Henley's tests. On it.
Dr. Yang.
"I don't know"?
I'm here. I am trying.
But taking point right now is ... I am not asking you to be in an o. R.
I am asking you to say something, to participate.
We're at a crossroads, Yang, A crossroads where you either get in the game ... Or I tell Richard it's time to send you home.
Imagine ... Seattle grace, The hospital that made heart surgery obsolete.
That's a ... Big claim.
Well, if the five million americans
Who suffer from heart failure
Could simply just regenerate their own damaged hearts ... I mean, it sounds like magic, but it ... it's possible.
It's happening.
Dr. Altman, stem cell research
Is on the cutting edge of every field of medicine.
Why cardio?
well, cardio and ... and neuro
Are the beacons of this hospital.
They're what put you on the map.
Look, you know what?
You ... you can't give this money to neuro.
I mean, neuro isn't even really a-a department.
It's just one strong surgeon.
You're better off putting your money on to a deeper bench.
What do you mean?
Well, Shepherd, he's like a charismatic cult leader.
He's very appealing and he's got a bunch of people hiding in his shadows, But ... well, don't get me wrong, he is a great surgeon, And he can pull off a flashy procedure, But is he really cultivating talent?
Is he taking the time to teach your residents, Knowing when to push and dishing out tough love when ... when they need it?
I mean, that's the hard part. I- I don't know.
Maybe Shepherd just doesn't like competition.
I mean, he tried to fire me.
Well, I mean, not that I'm holding a grudge or anything.
Well, not ... not much of one anyway.
I'm, uh, uh ... Well, I-I feel like I
should've stuck to my notes.
is teddy saying you could be fired?
Sounded that way. Well, is she trying to scare you? Is it working?
I don't think so. oh, damn it.
What's his problem?
Derek's got us competing for a brain shunt insertion.
The egg is the skull. You can break the shell, But you can't break the membrane.
Damn it!
I feel bad for him. He's kind of losing it.
I shouldn't be in charge of anybody.
Just put one foot in front of the other.
Just get through the day.
Grey!
You broke my concentration.
Sorry.
Um, hey, uh, post-ops look good, so if there's nothing else ... Oh, could you discharge 12-24?
And his chart needs to be dictated. Uh, yes, it's gonna have to wait
Until after I check on Torres' knee girl, Turf the window jumper to psych, Remove a June bug from some kid's ear in the pit, Write some meds for screaming-kidney-stones guy, And then deliver labs to my goiter lady. Stop bragging.
I can't. I was born for this kind of day.
No.
Stop.
Seth, no. Okay?
Okay? This can wait a couple of years.
Mom, you said this was my decision.
You said, after my bar mitzvah, I'd be a man and I could decide.
That is because we thought by 13, You'd make the mature decision. You can't just cut off
The parts of your body that you don't like, all right?
I don't like my thighs, okay? Or my saggy arms or my chin, But if we all cut off the parts we don't like, We'd all have nothing left. Mom!
Seth! Your father has the exact same chest as you, And nobody thinks he's a woman.
Look, would you please talk to her?
Uh ... I'm calling your father.
They call me booby at school.
Man boobs, double "d."
Some kid keeps hanging a bra in my locker.
I'm starting high school in a year.
It's gonna be all new people.
I just want to start over.
I want to be normal ... Like everyone else.
Why can't we just skip the panel?
We know I need the lungs.
Not everyone makes a good transplant candidate.
If someone can't reliably take their anti-rejection meds ... I can.
Or have severe disease in another organ. I don't.
Oh, well, there are just a lot of indicators
As to whether a person is strong enough to survive the surgery.
I want to know what she thinks, The one with the sourpuss on her face.
I don't have a sourpuss. This is just my face.
It's true. It is just her face.
You think I'll ... Pass the panel?
I couldn't say.
Oh, cheer up, sourpuss.
You're young, You got your health.
I think you're doing all right, both of you.
Practically kids and doctors, no less.
I bet your dads are really proud.
I'm from a small town, a farm, actually.
So yes, my dad was over the moon
When I became a doctor.
What about you?
Karev. Seth's mother just came by
Saying she wants to pull the plug on the kid's procedure.
That your idea of taking point? Well, I'm ... I'm gonna talk to her.
I spent two hours consulting with this family last month.
Ten minutes with you, they're ready to walk.
Pediatric surgery is 80%
parent management, Karev.
You know that. I'm handling it.
Megan, hi. Uh, I am Dr. Grey.
Just checking in to see how you're feeling.
Megan. Meg.
She doesn't hear well when she's texting.
I can hear her. Thanks.
Where's the other doctor ... Dr. Torres?
Oh, I'll ... I'll be checking you today.
How's your knee? Is the, uh, pain any better?
Look, you seem really sweet, But this whole, like, super-busy, messy-hair, Running-around-like- a-
banshee thing you have going
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
I mean, you don't even know my case.
Meg whealon, age 28, Tibial plateau fracture caused by a bicycle accident.
At least that's what you told the e. R. , But you told Dr. Torres that you were going 30 miles an hour, Which makes me think that you were on
Your boyfriend's motorcycle, and I'm gonna guess
That he has a license for it, and you don't. This is off the top of your head?
I memorized your chart. Your facture was fixed
With elevation and percutaneous screw fixture.
You are allergic to penicillin, currently on blood thinners
To make sure you don't develop d. V. T. , And if you would just talk to me about your knee, Then I could adjust your pain meds and be out of your hair. She's good.
You're good.
I'm busy, but I can handle it.
Every doctor in this hospital needs trauma training ... Disaster training.
You've got a strong department.
No, no, not just my staff. Everyone.
11 people died in that shooting.
Now eight of them ... Never had a chance, But the other three could've been saved.
Charles percy had a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Miranda Bailey did everything that she was trained to do.
She gave him fluids, controlled the bleeding, applied pressure.
Then she tried to get him to an o. R. , but she couldn't, And so he died.
Now a doctor with disaster training
Would've been able to assess that environment more quickly and would've known an alternative escape route.
Dr. Bailey was not trained to do that, And neither are 90% of the doctors on your staff.
She'll remember him dying in her arms
For the rest of her life.
And I'll remember.
And you'll remember that we could've saved him.
We failed her.
We failed Charles percy, One of our own doctors.
I can't face that.
I can't face that ever again.
Can you?
I'd like to expand the burn unit at Seattle grace, Make us the go-to destination for serious burn victims.
I'd also like to upgrade us
To a real nationally renowned center
For cosmetic reconstructive surgery.
Two subspecialties?
Well, revenue from the cosmetic center
Will help support the burn unit.
One hand scratches the other.
It's a nice idea, And an awfully ambitious plan for $1 million, And a tremendous amount of work.
I'm not seeing anyone right now.
I'm not sleeping with nurses ... Residents, attendings, nobody.
So I'm an untapped source of raw power.
I'm telling you, I have the energy of ten men.
So with your $1 million and my untapped stores, We can move mountains.
Are you excited? I'm excited.
Leave.
Right now. Just ... Just ... Mrs. Gruberman, every surgery has its risk, But this one is pretty simple. Look, it'll make your son
Feel a whole lot better about himself.
Well, if the surgery is really a good idea, I would like to hear it from Dr. Robbins and Dr. Sloan. Look, I'm ... No. I will speak to Dr. Robbins and Dr. Sloan.
Cristina. Cristina. Roy's labs.
He's got fungal pneumonia, And his creatinine clearance is dangerously low.
I mean, if it gets any worse, we're looking at renal failure.
I'm surprised he was sitting up and talking.
I mean, a-after surgery, Couldn't the immunosuppressants kill him?
Maybe.
Well, okay, I-I-if we don't recommend him, he dies.
But, uh, if we recommend someone who won't survive, Then it's just a waste of an organ
That could've gone to someone else. What do you think?
I don't know. You need to know.
We have to have an opinion. We called the stupid panel.
we have to stand up in front of teddy ... and the chief and a roomful of doctors
And recommend whether this guy lives or dies.
It's right down the middle with this guy, like a trick question.
He's a trick patient.
fine. Forget it.
The right opinion, the only opinion that matters is teddy's, So I will just figure out what she thinks, And I will say that.
Okay.
D- don't you care at all?
Come on.
You gotta care.
no, you did not say that to the chief.
Oh, god. It's your fault, you know? You psyched me out.
What? All I ever do is support you.
Oh, look at that face. That's her game face.
She's ... she's in it to win it. No.
Oh, hey, Karev, did you talk to seth's mother?
No, she's thinking about it. She may want to talk
To you guys again. Way to handle it.
What? I can't force her to listen to me. Keep your face in that book. It'll inspire confidence.
oh, my god.
Okay, that's getting in someone's head.
I'm just honest.
Oh, I'm up with the chief. I gotta go.
Oh, knock him dead. Oh, wait. Here.
I brought you tissues, just in case.
Oh.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
You have a sickness. Hmm?
You do. What?
okay, 30 seconds.
If neither one of you breaks the membrane, I'm gonna have to judge you on precision, So make sure your initials are clean and clear. Dr. Shepherd.
Yes. Stop talking!
Five, four ... Three, two, one.
Time. Ah.
What do you got?
Oh, not bad.
What about you, Dr. Avery?
I just wish I had more time.
Oh, really?
You did your whole name?
What? !
You conned me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He hustled me. He went through two dozen eggs and made me think I didn't have to practice. Well, if you didn't practice, Meredith, You were overconfident.
Dr. Avery, congratulations. You have the surgery.
And then I would take the remaining money and invest it in resources
For less invasive pediatric cancer surgeries.
Even the smallest change
Could dramatically improve the lives of so many children.
Wouldn't that be amazing?
Well, that is a very compelling and very focused presentation, Dr. Robbins. You seem surprised.
No. No, not at all.
Did you think I was gonna cry?
Yeah.
Yeah. um ... Torres suggested that I
was going to cry as well.
I think that we should all try
To wipe the whole crying thing out of our memories.
It happens very rarely, it's ... Embarrassing, And ... and frankly, I think that I've got it under control.
And the fact that my colleagues
See me as the type of person who would burst into tears
In the middle of an important, professional situation, Well, that doesn't make me weepy. That makes me mad.
Like, violent. It makes me want to punch someone.
And, you know, I-I'm the daughter of a marine, sir, So I was taught to hit as a child.
I was taught to hit fast and hit hard
So you only have to hit once, and now I feel like hitting
A person or a wall ... no, a person.
Let's just circle back to the sweet little children.
Here you go. Thank you.
I like the dark blue scrubs on you. You look good.
You okay?
My patient deserves a doctor.
You don't have to cut. Nobody's asking you to.
I know that. I know ... I know what's being asked of me, And I'm doing it.
Okay, I got an idea.
And I-I think it's gonna help.
You and me, we're gonna go outside ... Mm-hmm.
Into the alley behind the hospital, And you're just ... you're just gonna kick my ass.
You're gonna knock the living crap out of me.
There you are.
I knew you were in there somewhere.
At the end of this day, good or bad, We're gonna go home together.
Whatever it takes to get him home.
I just want to get him home.
Yeah, um ... 13 is young for plastic surgery, But your kid's not gonna grow out of it.
He's already gone through puberty, And his father's had the same condition his entire life.
Look, if he had weight to lose, I would advise diet and exercise, But your kid doesn't have a weight problem.
He has breasts.
He needs excision of the glandular tissue.
And yeah, it could wait till he's older, But he's a dude with breasts, and he's headed for high school, And there's no reason he should be subjected
To the psychological damage
That comes from years of taking schoolyard crap.
Look, you want your kid to be a man?
Let him make his own decisions.
Any other questions?
Hey. I got a page. Is everything okay?
Something's wrong. First she had a headache, and then ... I can't see. Everything is blurry. Okay, look right here.
I am freaking out. Tell me I don't need to freak out.
The whole left side of my body feels weird.
I thought it was because I fell asleep on it, but it's tingling. Okay, squeeze my hand.
She had knee surgery. What the hell is going on?
I don't know yet, but I'm gonna order a head c. T. , And then I am going to page for a neuro consult.
Looks like
You're gonna get to see another doctor today after all.
The minute I hand you this drill, you're on your own.
You may have hustled Dr. Grey, But you better not have hustled me.
This is not a game.
This is a real brain.
I got it. I'm ready.
Dr. Shepherd, Lexie Grey is paging for a consult, repeatedly.
I'm in surgery.
Dr. Grey.
Well, are you sure? I wouldn't want to be overconfident.
cardio is not my thing. What?
neuro is my focus, And this is cardiothoracic, And I've had relatively little experience with cardiothoracic.
And yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna walk in there today and humiliate myself, Or humiliate you, or teddy, or the chief.
You know, really, Anyone who could possibly be humiliated by my failure
Is gonna be humiliated today.
He was admitted two days ago.
Teddy could've convened a panel yesterday, But she didn't.
she doesn't think he's a candidate.
No, she doesn't, so just say that, and you'll be fine.
Everyone will be fine except for roy, Who will be dead.
Wow.
Way to kill a happy moment.
Where's Shepherd? I paged Shepherd. You got me.
Are you her boss? 'cause there's something seriously wrong here. I am. Sir, I need you to go to the waiting room right now.
But I ... right now.
Sir, come with me. Okay, um, she's ... she's post-op day two
From a tibial plateau fracture.
She ... she was fine all day, fine, and then ten minutes ago, She started complaining of headache, blurred vision and tingling on the left side of her body.
I- I ordered a stat head c. T.
I cannot believe that you're the neuro consult. Is she on blood thinners?
Yes, for d. V. T. Prophylaxis. She's got a brain bleed. Let's book an o. R.H
how didn't I see this coming? Did you check her platelets?
Yes. And everything was normal?
Until now, yes. Okay, well, you checked her platelets, you got a c. T. , You called neuro. You did everything right.
The only thing you're doing wrong
Is standing around talking about it, wasting time, While we should be getting her to the o. R. You totally sounded like an attending.
Right? Let's page Shepherd 9-1-1. Okay.
Dr. Shepherd, it's Dr. Grey again.
Meredith Grey.
Just passing the ventriculostomy tube now.
Almost there. All right.
Take your time, Dr. Avery. You want to make sure that ... Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
I ... what did you do?
And that is why the future of ortho is in xenografting.
you think I'm nuts.
You're thinking, I don't want some cow ligament in my leg.
That sounds wacky.
Is that supposed to be my voice?
no. That's the ... The voice of the average baby boomer.
I was hoping for something more ... Inspirational.
For ... for example, Dr. Robbins suggested that we take a little ... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Tiny humans.
What?
Arizona's nicer than I am.
I'm ... I'm sorry.
She's more patient.
She went to hopkins. She's more renowned in her field.
She's a much better lesbian.
I mean, I was sort of a late bloomer in that area, But she's got this whole circle of lesbian friends, you know?
It's just like ... like this subculture.
And, uh, I'm always just ... I'm always just a little bit left out, Just a little bit talked down to
Because I have a long history of enjoying s*x with men, Which I don't think is something I have to apologize for.
Whatever. I'm just ... she's just ... she's ... She's just better.
So you want me to give ortho $1 million
To level the playing field in your relationship?
Also for the xenografting, Which, as I mentioned, is ... The future of sports medicine.
Can I ask you something? Hmm.
Are you one of those, uh, You know, what do you call 'em?
When someone's really smart, like a genius, But they're a little different, Like they don't know how to talk to people?
Are you asking me if I'm autistic?
That's the word.
oh, come on.
You barely said three words all day.
don't be offended. You're a tough nut to crack.
I like that about you. My daughter's the same way.
Were you able to make contact with her? Oh, yeah. She's not coming.
I'm not all that surprised.
You know, messy divorce. She sided with her mom.
I mean, I hate it, but I get it.
Life goes on.
So it's just you and me, sourpuss.
Dr. Yang, the, uh, panel is gathering now.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Hold on one second. Hold on. Hold on.
Here you go.
Thank you.
This is gonna go my way, right?
I mean, they just don't send people home to die?
I want to live.
We'll let you know.
Is there anything I can do or ... I don't know, avery. Is there anything you can do? Thank you. Doctor.
Where are you? Uh, we're having a problem.
I'm fixing it now. Okay, I've got a post-op ortho patient
On d. V. T. Prophylaxis with a subdural hematoma.
Derek, she's got a blown pupil. I'm not gonna be there for a while, So you gotta take care of it yourself. What?
You wanted a solo surgery today. Now's your chance. Take point.
I need loops and a headlight.
Here you go, doctor.
Okay, scalpel.
If I root against him, does that make me a bad guy?
The patient's a child, Mark.
All right, Karev, you got this.
If you don't, we're right here.
All right, people, here we go. 10-blade.
* ... Hearts *
* some with wings and some with scars *
* there's an angst deriding good cheer *
* like a relic pulled from grasp *
* in the city, there's a great outcry *
* oh, the fire! *
* oh, the fire! *
* in the city there's a great laughter *
* heard from canyons over plains *

Okay.
You're letting kepner lead the transplant panel?
Well, Yang's been useless. She's no better than an intern.
* ... For you *
* look alive, look alive *
Did you just stop that bleeder?
Uh-huh. How did you even know to do that?
Okay. Sorry I'm late.
That's okay. Lexie made a good call.
I've got it under control. What do we got?
Let me finish, Derek. I got this.
* look alive, look alive *
* there's something in this ... Day for you *
Yes, you do.
I'm gonna find a cure for alzheimer's.
The cure for alzheimer's ... With $1 million?
With $1 million. It's a start.
You're talking about a clinical trial, A clinical-surgical trial?
Yes.
Start-up costs alone, never mind the f. D. A. , Derek, it's ... Today I watched Meredith perform
An emergency craniotomy by herself.
She was perfect.
She's got her mother's talent.
She's got her mother's looks, Richard.
What if she has her mother's disease?
Ellis was young when it started.
Every time Meredith forgets her keys
Or asks what day of the week it is, I ... When that $1 million runs out, Investors are gonna throw money my way
For the same reason I am gonna throw
Everything I got at this trial, because their dad has it, Or their wife.
Breakthroughs don't happen because of the medicine.
Real breakthroughs happen
Because someone is scared to death
To stop trying.
They're gone?
Well, there's some swelling, But that should go down with some time.
I don't have boobs.
I- I don't have boobs?
You don't have boobs.
She was scared. Now she's just happy you're okay.
You're the man.
No, you're the man.
Roy henley has end-stage pulmonary hypertension.
He has reached the point of no return, And at this point, nothing short of a lung transplant
Will save him.
Unfortunately ... Unfortunately, his cultures
Revealed that he has fungal pneumonia, His liver enzymes are worrisome, And on top of everything else, His creatinine clearance is only 75, Which means that he is on his way to kidney failure.
The immunosuppressants after surgery
Could very likely kill him, And so ... With regret, I conclude that he does not belong
On the waiting list.
Dr. Kepner, if you don't believe he's a candidate, Why in the world would you convene a panel today?
That is ... A very good question, chief.
I did think that he was a candidate
Earlier in the day, But the longer I
looked at his criteria, The more glaring it became.
It became glaring the more you looked at it?
Well ... Also, um, n-new facts came to light.
Um ... The patient has no support system.
Uh, no one to take him for post-op visits, Or make sure that he complies with his meds.
Ear-earlier in the day, he said he had a daughter, But later it came out that they're estranged.
that's not a reason.
Dr. Yang ... Do you have something to add?
You don't believe that having a support system in place
Is an important factor in this decision?
It's one factor.
But this guy is borderline, I mean, that's why we're here.
We could talk about his criteria all day.
I mean, his creatinine clearance is low but not critical, And his ... his ... His fungal pneumonia is bad but treatable.
I mean, he's borderline.
But I've been involved in
27 transplant surgeries, And every time, The patient's will to fight is just as telling, And roy has it.
If we give him the lungs, it won't be a waste, 'cause he will live.
I know it.
Dr. Brooks to oncology.
Dr. Brooks to oncology.
So how am I ... What am I
supposed to say to her?
That I botched the insertion and ... and then, uh, I punctured the vessel, or maybe that an error was made, Or ... you don't tell her anything.
You made a mistake. It happens all the time.
I had to yell at you because that's my job.
My job now is to ... our job now is to go in there
With smiles on our faces and tell her
The surgery was a success, because it was.
Hey. How are we?
There they are, our heroes.
The ringing stopped.
it stopped.
That's fantastic news.
And the kid did good, right?
The kid did good.
I'm kissing you now, 'cause I was wrong.
But in this moment, I am in love with you.
Mwah. oh, thank you.
Mm.
we were supposed to be a team today.
And then you just turned on me?
I didn't plan it.
I'm not used to failing.
Neither am I.
Okay? All right.
I know you think recommending him
Was the wrong decision.
I'm sorry, but I just ... Didn't agree.
Cristina, in a case like this, The right decision ... Is making a decision.
That's what we do. That's the job.
You formed an opinion and you argued for it.
And you weren't alone.
The panel voted to put him on the list. Congratulations.
You were a doctor today.
All right. Talk to me.
Um, there is a broken c. T. Machine in the basement, Next to it is a broken argon laser and a broken fluoroscope.
I think $1 million would repair all 3 of them.
And there might even be enough money left over
To put a new nurse on the night shift, Which is what our patients really need.
That's it?
That's what you got for me?
That's your best idea?
This assignment couldn't have been clearer ... Inspiration, good, old-fashioned competition.
Not you coming in here
Telling me I need to fix what's old and broken.
Um, I would love to go to paris, But you don't see me sitting around
Planning my parisian vacation.
It sounds nice, but I am a mother, And what I really need to do
Is get my kid to preschool, get the laundry done, Put food on the table.
All right, I can do a big tap dance here
About how I'm gonna change the face of medicine
With $1 million, But come on, you can't do anything with $1 million.
$1 million is nothing.
That's a dream. This is real life.
Preschool, laundry, food ... I'm realistic.
Change the face of medicine ... We need to fix the medicine that we already have.
We need a new night nurse.
We need these broken machines repaired.
Let's not go to paris. Let's go to the grocery store, chief.
And while we're being honest, Why are you wasting our time with this exercise anyway
When you and I both know you don't have $1 million?
Well, things may be a little different around here
In the next few weeks.
Look at that.
Now I can't call you sourpuss anymore.
Give me your arm, roy.
I have to draw some blood.
We all want to grow up.
We're desperate to get there, To grab all the opportunities we can ...
To live.
We're so busy trying to get out of that nest ...
* tell me, have I lost ... *
We don't think about the fact
That it's going to be cold out there ...
* the trains are ringing in the yard again *
Really freakin' cold.
Thank you, sir.
Congratulations. Good job.
Because growing up
Sometimes means leaving people behind.
Congratulations, doctor.
Thanks.
Oh, damn it. Where are my keys?
They're in your hand.
Oh.
And by the time we stand on our own two feet ...
We're standing there alone.Rails, hit the cyclist head on.

You heard 'em. Somebody page Shepherd. Let's move. got it.
We're on trauma rotation, so it's our job to take point and assess each medical emergency as it comes in.
let's get x-ray in here. you better be precise.
Talk to me, Grey.
His peripheral I. V. 's blown. Pressure's plummeting.

You know, sometimes the best thing you can do
Is know, you know, when to get out of the way.

When they stabilize him, I'll go in, and I'll do my stuff.

Does he have a pulse?
That's it. He's basically brain dead.
Um, excuse me one second, okay?
Dr. Hunt.
Excuse me.

We're still gonna have to crossmatch him.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Hey. Hey, look at this.
Blood type's a match, skin's a match, Age, size, gender, all matching.
We got our guy.
We got our guy?
We got our guy.
Oh, you picked a good night to start filming.
Yeah.
This is gonna be fun.

He said to hurry over, so we got out of bed and came in.
Right in. I mean, I was in such a hurry, I forgot my shoes.
Look. I've still got my slippers on.
Oh, we've been waiting for this for so long.
Today is the day. Today is my transplant day.
Yay, transplant day.
Gonna get me some arms!

Before I check on the patients and report to my attending.

For my colostomy reversal.
Oh, uh, babe, did we remember my robe and my fuzzy socks?
Yes, and yes, If by "we," you mean me, because you forgot.
I was supposed to get this surgery months ago, But ... Well, the shooting happened instead.
Did you get the parking ticket?
Yeah, in my pocket.
I haven't been back to the hospital since that day.
I don't know how it will feel to be back.
That's right, it's portman. P- o-r-t-m-a-n.
Uh, and can you tell me where I can get this validated?
I'll take care of it. Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, Dr. B.
Oh.
Yeah, I don't generally make it a habit
To hug my patients.
yeah, well, when you get paged 9-1-1, You don't walk. You never walk.
Okay, talk.
Okay.
God, I can't get past the obstruction.
Damn it. Howong? Five minutes.
Damn it.
Yes. Yes, do it now.
no, no, no, lily, lily, I know. I know. This is scary. You stopped breathing, And so we had to take you to the o. R.
And put a tube in your neck to help get you air.
No, no, no. You can't talk, okay?
But we called your mom at work, and she's on her way. Okay? lily was admitted with respiratory distress last night.
She has a, uh, growth on her windpipe.
It's benign except for, there's nothing benign
About something that's blocking your airway.
She's had surgeries to remove it in the past, But it's aggressive, it keeps recurring, And obviously, it's gotten worse, much worse.
okay, this is the nurse's button.
If you need anything, you push it.
I mean push it a lot. Don't worry about being annoying.
Push it till they come in here.
It's okay. It's all right.
Here.
Not too loud, okay?
it happens more than you think, Having to do a procedure on a kid with no parents around.
Some of these kids are in here for weeks.
The parents usually can't take off that much work.
But I mean, we try to help out.
We have these beds, we call 'em parent cots, For the parents to sleep in.
But a lot of these kids spend a lot of time alone.
Just works out that way.
Doesn't mean they're bad parents.
They're just, uh, busy parents.
I found out last night that he ... Had been in an accident.
Just before the phone rang, I had this ... sinking feeling.
Motorcycles ... Donor cycles ... isn't that what they call them?
They called me in here because even though sam's a donor, They need special consent for something like this.
I know sam would want to donate whatever he could, So of course, yes, they ... they could ... They could take his arms.
Absolutely. I have no problem with that.
Although, uh ... It's hard, you k ... The thought of somebody else, you know, Holding his hand.
See that? That could be a problem.
What if we try a bypass instead?
Hmm.
Derek and I? We go way back.
We grew up together, went to med school together.
he's ... He's kinda like my better half.
Not the better-looking half, mind you.
So when I heard he ghe got shot.
Every day, we give bad news to patients.
We tell them their loved ones are hurt ... Or dying ... Or dead.
And for the first time in my life, I understood what that feels like.
It feels like .
No, no, you're thinking like a nerve guy.
I am a nerve guy. Goes blood supply, then nerves.
Actually, it's tendons, then blood supply, then nerves.
Um, hello, what about the bones?
um, we estimate the surgery will take
Anywhere from 15 to 20 hours.
We'll have two o. R. S going at once.
There will be five teams of surgeons, One team for each arm, And then a fifth just to harvest veins from the leg.
You know there's only been one successful
Bilateral arm transplant in the country? In the world.
In the world. Yeah, I wouldn't go so far
As, uh, calling us medical titans, but ... we are.
not the first time I've been called a titan.
uh, right now, I am prepping the donor body
To extract antibodies from his blood.
This is all in preparation for later, When we'll remove, uh, bone marrow from the donor, And then we'll infuse the marrow into zack
To reduce the chances of his body rejecting the arms, Which is huge.
More than huge.
I mean, I'm no medical titan, but, uh ... Still it's pretty damn cool.
Uh, yeah, zack lost his arms four years ago.
It was an accident at work.
He is, uh, he was a logger.
So it coulda gone either way.
I mean, it ... this thing coulda come between us
Or it could've brought us closer together, And for us ... I think it's brought us closer.
Literally. I have to wipe his for him.
okay, really?
That'shat you want to talk about
In front of everyone right now? Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry. I'd cover my face, but I don't have any hands.
you been good since I last saw you?
Busy.
Bill and I, uh, left town right after the shooting, And ... Pretty much never looked back.
So far, we've been to paris, Morocco, alaska ... A cruise through the baltic.
What?
Blew through our savings, But ... Hey, life is short, right?
Sure is.
Is there anything I'm looking forward to
Once my surgery is done?
babies.
Lots and lots of babies.
deep breath.
Another.
enter security access code.
You're sure? You're sure?
I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure.
enter security access code.
there are some kinks with the new security system, But ... but there are always kinks with something ... n-new. Ah.
But we're ... we're working them out.
we got this, uh, new, state-of-the-art
Like, lockdown system.
to, um, isolate different areas of the hospital
In case of an emergency. Yeah, 'cause, um, Supposedly, the last emergency, There were ... Some people wandering around.
Even with the kinks, I think people feel safer, Which is important, yeah.
Uh, sorry to interrupt, chief.
I just ... I got your page, but hey, I can come back.
Oh, nonsense.
Congratulations. I just heard the big news, And I am so proud of you.
Oh.
Uh, our very own, um, Dr. Robbins here
Has been award
The prestigiousn, um, carter madison grant.
yeah, I haven't told that many people yet.
A carter-madison grant? Nobody wins those.
I mean, nobody normal. I mean, just sort of
Those brainy, scientist types who are from germany and sweden.
Oh, my god! You won! Are you kidding?
Nope. She's not kidding. Oh, come here.
Aw, thank you.
No, I didn't apply for the grant because of the shooting.
There are major gaps
In the care of children in developing countries.
Global health initiatives exist for things like malaria, Uh, infectious diseases, immunizations, But not for pediatric surgery, And with this grant ... I could start to change that.
Well, I applied for this thing two years ago.
I was a completely different person.
You know, I was new here, um, a surgical fellow ... Single.
But now I have people here, Important people, which ... Complicates things.
But ... this is bigger than me.
This is ... this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
So ... yeah, Of course I'm accepting the grant.
That just means I'm ... moving to africa.
*
coming up on "Seattle medical" ... how long has he been coding? !
um, Dr. Torres, have you seen this?
oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
something like this could ruin everything.
Well, I mean, not just anyone's a good arm donation candidate.
Not every candidate s donated arms.
Most, uh, amputee patients opt to continue using prosthetics.
When you think about it, We're attaching two cadaver arms
To another living person's body.
That's the kind of thing
That could really mess with someone's head.
Not to mention the rehabilitation time.
Recovering from something like this, it takes years.
Well, the screening process is, uh, extensive.
We have to ensure that the recipient
Is stable mentally and physically, Determined, patient, very patient.
And that's all before you even begin looking for an arm.
Uh, in this case, we've been looking for arms for zachary
For over two years.
It's been a long time coming.
Um, Dr. Torres. Hmm?
Uh, you've probably seen this, But ... but h-have you seen this?
oh, my god. No.
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
okay, um, page Sloan right now.
a tattoo?
It's just so unfair that something like this
Could ruin everything.
hi. Is it true?
Are you guys scrubbing in on the ... Double arm transplant?
What's wrong with you?
nothing.
What's wrong with you?
oh, no, yeah.
It's a very real concern, actually.
The patient could easily reject the arms, Not just physically but emotionally.
The first-ever hand transplant recipient
Ultimately asked to have the hand removed.
Yeah, he said he couldn't connect to it, That it felt like dead weight sewn on to his body, That the hand wasn't and never would be his.
Imagine looking at a tattoo of your donor's wife's name
Every day to remind you that these aren't your arms. you're making me nervous. What's wrong?
Is there a problem with the arms?
oh, god. There's a problem with the arms.
Well ... Maybe.
Um ... There's a tattoo on one of the arms
Of the name "nicole."
I love the name nicole.
Me, too. I love it. We couldn't love it more.
I sawe rename our dog nicole.
I'm gonna name myself nicole.
change my name.
If it means I can still get those arms, Then ... Nicole is my new favorite name.
Yeah.
I was ... I was not expecting that.
He got that tattoo exactly one year after we met.
He took me to the tattoo shop and told me
He was gonna get this tattoo
To show me just how much he loved me, which ... Is when I'm pretty sure I called him an idiot or something worse.
You don't clare your love for someone by getting a tattoo.
You do normal things, like ... Like plan a nice date, or ... or write a poem, Or hell, drop down on one knee and propose.
You don't brand yourself with another person's name.
Which is when sam said,"okay,"
And he got down on one knee, Pulled out a ring and proposed ... On the spot.
After that, every time ... Even if we were fighting
Or I was mad at him because he forgot to ... Take the garbage cans out or ... I'd catch a glimpse of that tattoo, And I'd remember, this guy loves me.
Even if the garbage is gonna smell up the yard for a week ... He loves me.
Loved me.
I don't even like kids.
Come on.
Oh.
Ugh!
pediatric surgery
Has nothing to do with liking kids.
All right, lily. I need you to stay still, okay?
Or you're gonna mess up the test.
I'm gonna be right over there in that booth, And that's how it goes.
Lily, you can't have this in the machine, okay?
I'm sorry.
Hey, look, guys, Why don't you back off for a little while, okay?
Hey. it's gonna be okay.
I mean, you go into peds because it's elite, You know, uh, hard-core, the best of the best.
* na na na, dum and rain *
* instead of driving me insane *
* but I can't stay mad at you for anything ... *
Did you know that there are
Only 38 pediatric surgery fellowship spots in the country?
The country.
I mean, uh, to compare, cardiothoracic has 120.
pediatric surgery is the elite of the elite, So yeah, I'd consider specializing ... in pediatric surgery, for sure.
But not because of the kids.
definitely not because of the kids.
* and I wouldn't change a thing *
airway's clear.
you know, the truth is that
It's actually a good thing that ... The shooting happened here instead of somewhere else, Because we are better equipped to handle trauma.
I mean, we see trauma every day. It's our job.
we got a stab wound there.
Yeah, I-I got it. put him on a monitor.
Thank you. Oh, wow.
Uh, he needs surgery.
Okay, let's pack it, Stabilize him, and get him upstairs. right away, doctor.
Right. Right. Um ... There's another incoming trauma on his way in, So I'm just gonna stay down here and handle that.
yeah, I mean, trauma is a part of our job,
So improvising and thinking on our feet, That's what we're trained to do.
no, it's not strange Dr. Yang isn't coming with me.
I was available, so I'll take this guy, She'll take the next one. It's first come, first serve.
Everyone wants to get in that o. R.
We're surgeons. We live to cut. It's who we are.
it's not too late, you know?
We could move up our next trip, Skip out of here, and ... and just catch a plane tonight.
I mean, you've been fine this long without the surgery.
You'd be fine a little longer.
colostomy reversal is a very basic surgery.
On a typical day, I might do two or three in a row.
Uh, this was the surgery
I was supposed to perform on mary that day.
The day that ... That ... that, um ... Anyway, um, Medically speaking, She was getting a little stoma prolapse and some electrolyte imbalances, So it's good that we're doing the surgery now.
Good to get it over with.
So we just got lily's labs back, And I'm taking 'em to Dr. Robbins.
They don't, uh ... I mean, I'm just saying, I think that at least you could be happy. Well, I thought we were hap ... uh, should I come back?
No, whatever. We're done anyway.
Uh, you have ... you have lily's results?
well, it's her decision, obviously.
it's an incredible opportunity.
I mean, you don't just, uh, Turn down a carter madison grant.
Nobody turns down a carter madison grant.
I mean, I-I ... I know that. I ... I understand that. I do.
I mean, if the situation were reversed ... Oh.
Actually, no. You know wha no.
If the situation were reversed, I would turn the thing d
I wouldn't even consider
Moving to another continent right now.
But I'm not her.
So, uh ... Like I said, it's an incredible opportunity.
Hope you've got that bone saw ready, 'cause I am really in the mood to cut off some arms.
unfortunately, because of her prior surgeries, Lily has fistulas
That make removing her tumor that much more difficult.
The tumor is now so large
That it's impinging on her airway and esophagus.
Removing the tumor
Would mean removing lily's entire trachea, Which means ... Lily wouldn't be able to breathe at all.
the other thing
That's changed for me most since the shooting is that ... Now I feel like ... There's always something that we can do, 'cause I should've died.
You know, I was shot point-blank.
So, uh ... There's always something that we can do.
so you're saying ... That if you operate ... It's a death sentence, And if you don't operate, it's a death sentence?
So in a few minutes, we'll be ready
To completely detach the arms from the donor.
Why use zigzag incisions?
to get maximum exposure.
Good. See what I'm doing here?
I'm tagging each vessel, artery and vein
So we know exactly how to hook them up to the recipient.
It's kind of like the back of your tv.
You need to know which connection goes where, Or you wind up with sound and no picture
Or a picture and no sound.
the minute we remove the arms from the donor, The tissue starts to die, so we have to work fast, really fast.
We have a very limited window
To complete this part of the surgery.
Okay.
Okay, let's get started.
You don't understand.
I was sent to get coffee for Dr. Sloan
Because he needs his caffeine right now
To get through the most amazing surgery
That is happening right now in o. R. 2.
So I-I'm pretty sure it's not okay
To be late for the making of medical history, So you need to let me through, okay, To get to that surgery, to get Dr. Sloan his caffeine, To witness medical history being made.
I- I ... my I. D. Is valid, I promise.
Let me take a look.
Yeah, she ... she swiped it a couple times.
It didn't go through.
just go. Just go.
enter security access code.
hey. Hey. Anybody?
enter security access code.
Nurse! Come here.
Enter security access code.
Dr. Avery. Dr. Avery, your patient!
enter security access code.
Enter security access code.
Avery! Dr. Avery! Hold on! Dr. Avery!
Enter security ...
so we're about nine hours in.
Uh, Dr. Torres has finished attaching the donor arm bones
To the recipient with titanium plates and screws, And now they are beginning to attach the tendons.
I'm on it.
Where have you been?
has getting shot changed me?
Um, I don't think
I love my job any more or any less.
Um, I don't think I'm ... I'm a-a better doctor or worse.
Uh, if anything it's made me grateful, Um, to be here.
So yeah, getting shot has changed me
In the sense that I feel lucky.
We've reconnected the arteries and veins.
but we need to check the circulation
Before we continue.
What we're gonna do now
Is release the tourniquets one arm at a time and then look to see if blood flows into the vessels.
okay, moment of truth.
releasing the tourniquet.
arm's pinking up!
that's good. Good job, everybody.
The commute's tough.
We've been coming here
Since lily's tumor got diagnosed three years ago.
It's just the two of us, just lily and I.
We live over three hours away, So it makes it difficult for me to come more than twice a week and weekends.
I hate leaving her for that long.
But I just want what's best for her.
I want her to live.
Dr. Robbins came to me, and she said
There might be something they could do for lily after all ... Something experimental.
Um, that's why you come to a place like this, you know?
Because even if it is a commute, three hours on the road, It's nothing if ... if it'll save lily's life.
we've completed a stent
To temporarily help lily breathe, And now we're gonna remove part of her twelfth rib.
See? It's just one more example
Of how our doctors here rise.
First a carter madison grant winner, And now cutting-edge ... Regenerative medicine.
well, there's no artificial replacement
For a trachea.
We know that. But then I remembered a study, And I thought, well ... What if it isn't artificial?
We're gonna use some of lily's own cells
To manufacture her a new trachea.
Grow it in the lab, remove the damaged organ, Replace it with a newer model.
Outstanding.
Absolutely outstanding, Dr. Robbins.
let me in here. Move. Avery, avery!
Avery, look, I was waiting in radiation.
How's the patient?
Damn it! How long has he been coding? !
Avery, you're gonna break his ribs.
enter security access code.
Okay, okay, okay.
O- okay, okay, okay.
The new security system? Yeah, I'm not a fan.
compressions only last for so long, So you call whoever you need to call, You override whatever you need to override, And you open the door before I report you
For the wrongful death of a patient!
avery.
Avery, it's okay. Just hang in there, okay?
enter security access code.
Avery.
all right, you can stop now.
Someone else can take over.
Avery, look at me. Look at me. You can stop now.
Avery, avery, it's okay. It's okay.
it's been, uh ... Hard ... Since the shooting.
I, uh, I lost some fr ... some friends that day.
you learn to think about things differently.
Like, um, like buttoning a button ... You can't ... you can't do that, You know, even with the hooks, so ... Now I just buy zack t-shirts and hoodies.
He can usually get those on by himself
By using his hooks and his feet.
And, uh, I help him bathe in the morning, And ... Well, brush his teeth and shave.
It took me ... It took me a long time to get the hang of that.
but it's all in the wrist, I've learned.
It's late.
I thought I w ... I would have an update by now.
So what's the big deal? You'll visit her.
She'll visit you. It's just a plane ride. Um, can we not talk about this right now?
arms getting cyanotic.
The vessel attachments are all good.
uh, picture. We've got picture and no sound.
excuse me?
Move over. Just move over.
Any update?
What? Just tell me.
Um ... There was a possible complication
With one of the arms.
Complication?
There's a clot, And they're trying to, uh, restore blood flow.
But ... He could lose it, couldn't he?
well ... One arm's better than none, right?
Torres, do you need help? I can retract that for you.
Want me to patch that?
just give me a second.
are you sure you don't want me to ... I know what I'm doing ... Torres, do you want me to patch this? Just give me a second.
Okay, I know what I'm doing. I just need a second.
Everybody, shut up.
Okay. All right.
There. Picture and sound, I think.
yeah.
good job.
good. Nicely done.
basically, we break the cartilage down
To its cellular level and turn it into a protein liquid.
We build a scaffolding to hold the liquid, Then we cook it in an incubator to let it grow.
This is the incubator.
We're gonna grow the trachea in here first.
And then once it's big enough, we're gonna insert it
Into lily's abdomen till it gets stronger.
It'll be there a few months.
then we'll take that new trachea and replace her old one.
Some might say that a shooting would set people back.
Then you look at residents like Dr. Karev and attendings like Dr. Robbins, And you see their ... their innovative thinking, Their resilience.
You see them becoming reinvested in ... in medicine.
It's inspiring, isn't it?
I've mobilized the two intestinal segments, And I've stapled, And ... That's it.
Textbook. In an out in an hour.
Time to close.
it went well.
Uh, mary's being wheeled into recovery right now.
So it's ... It's over?
It's over.
Oh, god.
Oh, thank you.
Oh. Oh. thank you.
okay.
Thank you.
Oh.
this is, uh, One surgery I am happy ... to have finished.
Tonight ... You know, I may very well take the night off.
Go out. Maybe have a drink.
Who knows?
oh, man.
Oh, gentlemen and lady ... Hey.
We gave a man arms today. We did.
All right. I like to think of it more as I gave a man arms today.
The rest of you just helped. Another round for everybody but my friend here.
come on. That's a really nice shirt, by the way.
Where'd you get that, the special titan store? Hey, you saw the way she saved that arm today?
You want to hear something funny?
She hooked up my tv.
I'm still only getting sound out of one speaker.
so I'll have to irrigate the trachea
With this protein mixture a few times a day, Every day, for the next few weeks ... which means I'll pretty much be living in this hospital
To make sure it gets done right.
That's my priority, is to make sure this trachea grows.
I mean, it's my focus.
I'll basically be eating, breathing and sleeping trachea
For the next month.
Do people treat me differently now, after the shooting?
Uh, well, um ... I mean, yeah.
I mean, like, you're here filming me, so ... I mean, like, people like to say what I did was heroic, But it wasn't. You know, it was just a thing I had to do.
I think people like to have a hero, And, uh, it ... it ... it ... It makes them feel better to think that, There in the middle of all that horror, You ... you know, that there's someone ... Special working medical miracles.
But ... I mean, I ... I- I mean, I don't ... I don't have super surgical powers.
You know, I mean, I'm ... I- I did what ... Cristina is a hero ... Especially to me.
The truth is, is most surgeons
Could not have done what she did that day.
If you had seen ... stop.
If you had seen ... Stop. Please just ... can you ... can you just stop this?
Can we cut?
just doing a little construction.
Things are always evolving around here ... For the better.
Always for the better.
whoa! hey!
I don't know. Man, I don't know.
Are you kidding me? You guys all right?
hey, let me give you a hand.
Uh, yeah, I mean, he already has some feeling
At the tops of his new arms, like ... ow!
watch this.
Not bad, huh?
pretty good.
Look right there.
You can barely even see a scar
Where they put the tube in last month.
And now I'm back today
To get my new trachea sewn into my belly.
Dr. Karev calls me the human incubator.
He's been sending me photos from the lab, Of my new trachea.
See?
Look at that right there.
It's really grown.
See? Right there.
I always figured I'd grow up to be a rock star, But I might consider being a doctor now, too.
I mean, Dr. Karev is pretty cool.
Check it out. Homegrown trachea.
Whatever you do, Just don't screw around and mess up my trachea, okay?
I mean it.
I know you think you're a rock star, But no mosh pits or crowd surfing.
I mean, lilith fair's okay, But no drinking, or drugs, or smoking, or driving drunk, Or giving your number out to guys you don't know.
Um ... You get that I'm 9?
* the time you lost your mind *
* there's always *
* something sneaking up behind *
* you know *
* the way to go *
well, I-I really can't believe it.
The big move to africa is really just around the corner.
Yes, I would say things are better between us now, And, uh, yes, we worked it out
Even with arizona moving to africa.
The fix was, uh, pretty simple, actually. I'm going with her.
Hi.
Did you get them, um ... * tell me there's still ... *
got you some new flowers.
Uh ... Yellow ones today.
Uh, don't ask me what kind. I have no idea.
* you know the way to go *
They're, uh, they're pretty, though, Just like you.
* the way to go *
it's rare, But sometimes patients do not wake up from surgery.
With every surgery, there is a risk.
In this case, the post-operative c. T.
Showed no sign of stroke, No acute bleed.
We've run p. E. T. Scans, m. R. I. S, Tried fluids, pressors.
Basically, that's what
I have to go and talk to bill about today.
Mary has been in a coma since her surgery.
There's no sign of brain activity.
And now she's septic.
Her organs are failing.
Best-case scenario, Um, she regains some function and wakes up with extreme deficits, Mentally and physically.
But the chance of her ... Waking up at this point ... * you know *
it's hard ... To imagine someone surviving a crazy gunman, And then not to survive such a simple surgery.
I have to go and tell bill that it's time.
* back home *
He has a decision to make.
* back home *
* you know *
* the way to go *
* back home *
* back home *
* back home *
Hi.
Well, we went through
The scariest thing a person can go through, And we survived.
So now every day is just a gift.
And we're all just blessed ... Blessed to be here, Blessed to be doing what we do best
Not bad, huh?
Which is saving lives ... Every day ... One life at a time.
we're healed ... So we can continue healing others.
is there any one thing
You'll take away from all of this?
Being a hero has its price.question ... when was the last time A complete stranger took off her clothes in front of you, Pointed to a big purple splotch on her back, and asked, "what the hell is this thing? "
Okay. How about it, Mark?
You know you've always wanted one of ... These.
If you're a normal person, the answer is hopefully ...
never.
If you're a doctor ... The answer is probably ... About five minutes ago.
Nah. I'm good.
I will take that waffle iron.
What? I have never even seen you eat a waffle.
Well, I would if I
had a waffle iron.
okay, callie, We're not gonna take a waffle iron to malawi, And it's not gonna do anybody any good sitting in storage
For three years. People expect doctors to have all of the answers.
Congratulations. You won yourself a waffle iron. Oh!
And a french press.
Hey. Stop giving ... My things away.
* revolutionary mediocrity *
* it's like ay, ay, ay *
Maybe I should pass on the french press.
Hmm. The truth is, we love to think
That we have all of the answers, too. So the art & lesley phillips foundation
Does have a few more hoops to jump through than the others ... Mm-hmm.
But their primary focus is alzheimer's research.
And if you get this grant, It is more than enough to get us started. Wow. You really did your homework.
I'm a great student. Just the kind you want around
When doing a clinical trial.
How's that going?
It's fine.
Is this because Richard gave hunt the $1 million and not me
Is that why things are frosty between you two? We're not frosty. We're fine. E.
But if you're looking for solidarity, I would be more than happy to skip
Owen hunt's trauma certification lab.
Go. Get certified.
Okay. Basically ...
Doctors are know-it-alls ...
Until something comes along that reminds us we're not.
Hey, I need someone to help me
Set up the trauma lab and keep things running smoothly.
You'd get your certification that way, And it's a pretty easy day. It's a skills lab. It's already an easy day.
W ... Dr. Hunt, I'm going to need to borrow Dr. Yang.
Oh. Uh, what's up? Lungs have become available for roy henley, And since he found himself on the transplant list
Based on Dr. Yang's recommendation, I would say that that would make him her patient.
Okay. Uh, what do you need me to do?
Well, I just need someone to monitor him
While I go pick up the lungs. So I'll be on my own?
Nope. Dr. Mcqueen, the cardio fellow, He will be around on the off chance that you need anything.
Oh, and I finally was able to get roy's daughter
To agree to come in, So just, uh, keep an eye out for her, okay? Okay.
You'll be fine.
Still an easy day.
I know.
Am I early? I tried really hard not to be.
That doesn't bode well.
We did the same thing with Bailey when we were interns.
Take turns treating a dummy, get an early lunch, Then get back to work. It's lame.
Charter plane was forced into an emergency landing and collided with a greyhound bus.
Mass-casualty situation.
Do I need to say it again? Let's move.
Close to 30 victims in the field, some critical.
Multiple blunt trauma injuries.
and I was so looking forward to an early lunch.
This is gonna suck.
Welcome to trauma certification. You will work in teams of four.
Each team will be responsible for nine casualties.
You may treat your patients using only what you can carry
With your two hands from this ambulance.
The evac helicopter is on its way.
You get your patients on the helicopter, You get certified. Are you ready?
get to work.
Dr. Grey.
Uh, christy cornell, age 28.
She's here for a gluteoplasty.
She's so tiny. There's hardly anything there to lift.
That's sort of the point, Dr. Grey.
I'm ... Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry. That was ... Oh. I'm ... I'm ... I'm sorry.
Christy's not here for a lift.
She's here for a gluteal implant.
Yes. Finally gonna get some junk up in this trunk.
This program shows a rendering of what you can expect
The gluteus to look like after the implant.
Oh.
Um ... Could I see what it'd look like
Kicked up a ... just a couple of points? Sure.
mm.
Couple more?
Couple more?
Okay, stop. That's it.
That's my ass.
Oh, come on. that was funny.
Any joke that starts with an animal walking into a bar
Is scientifically unfunny.
Well ... humor me, Dr. Yang.
I need something to focus on.
I don't know if I'm more nervous about getting new lungs
Or about actually seeing my daughter.
Don't think of it as getting new lungs.
Think of it as getting rid of old, crappy lungs.
Or don't think at all. Okay, roy.
Take some deep breaths. Okay?
Corinne?
Roy.
How you been?
This week or for the past 20 years?
I'm sorry. That was snarky.
No. No, snarky's good.
I like snarky. You get that from me.
Roy? Roy?
Get the crash cart! He's ... he's not breathing.
v- fib! Page cardio.
Aren't you the doctor? Do something.
Um ... What-what's ... what's happening?
your father's developed cor pulmonale, And his heart is overloading.
What? I-I-I don't ... I don't understand.
I thought his lungs were the problem.
H- his lungs are putting extra pressure on his heart.
Dr. Altman is picking up the new lungs right now.
I'll call her and apprise her of the situation.
What situation? What is going on?
His heart is failing.
And the damage seems pretty severe, So ... Uh, there's a possibility
He'll need a new one.
A new what? A new heart?
You know what? Take over here.
I am going to call Dr. Altman, And, uh, uh, I'm gonna get mcqueen.
Dr. Bailey, do you have a second?
Only if what you have to talk about is more important
Than my being on time for an autopsy. Uh, that's arguable.
We're throwing Torres and Robbins
A bon voyage party
In the doctors'
lounge this evening.
Oh, that sounds lovely. Uh, I have a full day.
But I'll try and stop by. Well, the thing is altman volunteered, uh, To pick up the cupcakes, but she had to pick up lungs instead.
And I just figured, since you are close to both these ladies ... You're asking me to take time
Out of my very busy day to go to the bakery?
Or would you prefer
That I ran on home and baked some myself?
No.
Of course not.
Just an invitation.
Uh-huh.
Mark.
I need to talk to you about christy cornell's ... butt.
Okay.
But first I need to talk to you about cupcakes.
callie.
Check out all the great stuff the kids in peds made me.
They want me to take pictures of their crafts in africa.
Oh, wow. That's awesome.
You'd be surprised how often you find yourself in need
Of a macaroni face glued to a paper plate.
No. I mean, it's way better than gauze, Malaria pills, antibiotics. Well, you are a delight this morning.
Is there something that you'd like to talk about?
Um ... No.
No, I'm just ... no.
Ah.
Torres, Robbins.
Hi. I thought you'd be halfway to malawi by now.
Yeah, we had some last-minute paperwork.
Plus, I-I promised the kids I'd come and say good-bye.
That's good. The work you two will be doing there
Will reflect very, very highly on this hospital.
Sure, uh ... It was a surprise to learn that I'd have to replace two, Uh, excellent attendings as opposed to just the one.
But then that's a chief's problem.
No one wants to really hear a chief's problems.
It's a shame, though, Torres.
I had, uh ... I had such big plans for you.
big plans.
Irrigate and suction.
There. Clamp, please.
Dr. Mcqueen, I really need you to take a look at roy henley.
They tell me he's developed cor pulmonale and circulatory collapse. Yes, sir. That's correct.
Did you put him on dopamine, milrinone, and nitric oxide? Yes, I did.
He's stable. Critical, but stable. I ...
What would you do for a patient with reduced cardiac output, Hypotension, sinus tach, and metabolic acidosis?
I'd insert an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Exactly.
I'll be there when I can, Dr. Yang.
But it really doesn't sound like you need me at all.
Thank you. Irrigate and suction, please.
You must be Dr. Bailey.
I'm Dr. Stanley, head of pathology.
This must be ... Mary portman, 30, multiple organ failure, Cause unknown.
She came in for a standard colostomy reversal and never woke up. Well, all right.
Looks like we've got something we can sink our teeth into.
Um, I have a list of possible causes
I'd like to check as we proceed.
we have a specific order
To the way we work down here, So we'll see what we see when we see it, okay? Okay.
according to this card, This guy's got a blown right pupil, An atlantooccipital dislocation, open-book pelvis, A large open abdominal wound ... Jeez! ... A sucking chest wound with seven broken ribs.
This guy is all messed up.
Or he's dead.
Ah. Right. Yes.
Moving on.
Cristina?
Hey. How long have you been here?
Oh, not long. I just needed some fresh air.
And how's the patient?
Uh, he's fine. He's great. A couple of complications, But yeah, I'm handling it.
Are you sure that you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
It's, uh ... Chilly out here.
It's him. Um ... I need to ... I ... Have to go look.
Okay. All right.
Cristina.
Uh-huh.
You can do this.
Okay.
Thanks.
Grey.
Congratulations.
You're, uh, you're certified.
Now can you go inside and, uh, give Cristina a hand?
Well, what does she need? Did she ask for me?
Meredith ... Please.
Okay?
Yeah. Thanks.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Owen sent me. I don't need a babysitter.
I'm just an extra set of hands. What's the situation?
He went into cardiogenic shock, So I'm inserting an intra-aortic balloon pump and hoping there are no other complications
Before teddy gets back.
So we are watching for hemolysis, a gas embolism, A blue leg from peripheral ischemia ... Okay, you know, if you want to do something, uh, his, Uh, daughter is up in c. C. U. , and she needs an update.
Okay.
Blue team, status report.
We arrived on the scene to find nine casualties.
We identified three as priority one, Requiring immediate evacuation. Four were priority two, Allowing for delayed evac.
One was priority three, And the last was sadly ... Dead on the scene.
Nice work, kepner.
But it seems to me that you now have two dead patients.
Excuse me? Well, while you were standing around
Waiting for the helicopter to arrive and not keeping a constant eye on your patient's injury, This one developed a femoral bleed, bled out and is now sadly dead.
No, a-a femoral bleed ... that wasn't on the card.
Really? Well, it's on this one.
O- oh, no, no, no. Wait. That's not fair.
Patients don't suddenly die.
It just seems that way when you stop paying attention.
Food for thought. Red team, go. there were nine of them, but that guy over there
Was dead when we got here, so I guess that's eight ... I'm so sorry, you guys.
those guys right there are priority three.
We tagged these over here as priority two.
Awesome.
tell me about the bandaging on these two.
priority ones ... Right. The reservation's under stanley. Jennifer stanley.
4 people for 8:00.
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
Why would 8 people want to have dinner at 4:00?
* seven good deeds, you're a man of strength *
Dr. Stanley, the ... the clots
Could indicate a pulmonary embolus.
Let me talk to your manager. Dr. Stanley.
What's up? I was asking about those blood clots.
Now couldn't a pulmonary embolus have led to her death?
Those are postmortem clots, Dr. Bailey.
Perfectly normal. Hello. Hi.
Yes, there's been a mistake with my dinner reservation.
"big plans." "big plans."
you know what? I don't care.
I've got big plans myself ... great big african plans.
Yeah, you do. Yeah. I don't need to grow cartilage in a lab.
I'll be building bones from dirt.
I'll be figuring out how to create unbreakable joints
Out of blood diamonds.
I'll be ... I'll be making artificial limbs
Out of elephant ivory.
I'm pretty sure a couple of those would be frowned upon
By the world community. Oh, whatever. Science isn't about making friends.
The helicopter has to be getting here soon.
It's been three hours. Just ... just a few more minutes.
Here. Take these. Right? Right, Dr. Hunt?
The helicopter will be here any minute?
Nice rain gear, Karev.
Shouldn't you be more concerned with your patient staying dry?
Yeah, well, he's a dummy, and I'm a person, so ... You know, a dry patient is less likely to die
Of hypothermia or shock.
Something to think about.
Alex, you can't break the rules like that.
That's unsanctioned use of a trash bag.
You're gonna mess up our certification.
Oh, you need to relax. This whole uptight thing?
This is why you have no friends. Hey.
Okay, this is why you have one friend.
Give me that back!
Are you crazy?
There you go, little guy.
No hypothermia for you.
Everyone.
Green team's patients are all dead.
Only red team and blue team remain.
Whoa. You see a helicopter?
Take a knee, learn something.
Take a knee?
He's gonna scalp them.
We're in "apocalypse now, " and we're gonna get scalped.
That, right there. See what she's doing?
Okay, I-I swear. I'm ... I'm not an idiot.
I just ... if ... if Dr. Altman doesn't get this new heart, Is that, like, game over on the lung transplant?
Uh, there are a variety of factors.
Right now, I'm not sure, but I can get an answer for you.
Fine. Uh, where are we on the heart?
Again, not sure.
Dr. Altman should be calling with an update very soon.
Okay. Uh, when can I see him?
I have to check with Dr. Yang.
You're just like a ... You're just like a wealth of information, aren't you?
I'm sorry. I'm new to your father's case, And Dr. Yang is ... I called him roy.
I decided to do that on the drive over
'cause I hadn't seen him in 20 years, And I want to blame him for that.
I do blame him for that.
Except ... He tried.
He tried to be ... My dad in the beginning.
And ... I couldn't forgive him for leaving my mom.
And then he stopped trying.
and ... I have twins. They're 3.
And I don't even know if he knows that.
I never told him.
And then ... And then I walked in there ... And I called him roy.
I called my dad roy.
And I just ... I need for that
To not be the last thing he hears from me.
Please.
The daughter really needs to talk to you.
She has too many questions that I can't answer.
Why don't you try reading his chart?
Cristina, if you want to be pissed at me, that's fine.
But don't ... okay, you know what? We're not gonna do this right now, 'cause I'm kinda busy here.
Crap.
all right. Look, get him on ecmo.
That should keep him alive
Until I can get back with these lungs.
There is a shot that once we get them in, The heart damage will reverse without the excess pressure.
Teddy says we need to get him on ecmo. What's it look like I'm doing?
Okay, apparently, uh, Cristina's on it.
Grey ... How's she doing?
Uh, she is doing great. She's doing great.
Good, good.
Intestines show a well-healed anastomosis
With no evidence of infection, Inflammation, or necrosis.
I think this is as good a place as any to call lunch.
What do you say? Lunch? Well, we have to check
The adrenal glands and the kidneys.
What if the thyroid shows pathology? Don't worry.
Those kidneys aren't going anywhere on their own.
Yes, I'm aware, But microscopic pathological changes
Are harder to interpret
Once the organs start decomposing.
We'll only be gone 45 minutes. They'll keep.
Still, I don't think it's right ... Okay, Dr. Bailey, I'll see you in 45 minutes.
I don't know.
They're chocolaty looking with sprinkles. Where'd you get 'em?
At that grocery store down the street.
This isn't a baby shower for some nurse
Who couldn't keep her knees together, Grey.
Torres and Robbins deserve better than off-brand crap.
I'm not an errand girl. Okay? I'm a doctor with a patient
Who's about to make a giant butt-shaped mistake. That's not for you to say.
Okay, well, someone has to. The only reason a woman
Does something like this to her body is to impress a guy.
Okay, sure, it starts with a giant butt, and then
The next thing you know, she's giving up her friends, She's moving in with him before she's even ready, And if she's not careful, she'll find herself
A 26-year-old stepmother
To the pregnant daughter she didn't even know he had.
And then she's single, dyeing her hair a new color.
And you know what? It's really hard to manage your roots
When you've been committed to the psych ward. Psych ward?
It happens.
great. You're in here.
Now where can I sulk?
Oh, there's plenty of room. That's all I'm doing.
Please sit down.
What's the matter?
I have been down in the morgue all morning
Trying to determine the cause of death for mary portman, Who survived the horrors of gary clark
Only to die from a surgery that I perform every day.
So it's very important to me, And it's very important to mary's husband, To find some answers today.
But do you know what is important to the pathologist
Who is leading the autopsy?
Oh, her dinner reservations and her lunch break ... Basically food ... That's what's important to this pathologist.
Feeling better?
No. Not really, no.
What's all this?
Oh, I'm just trying to write this grant proposal.
Why only trying?
Because the more you research alzheimer's, The more depressing it gets.
And then when you include the early onset, The type that ellis Grey suffered from, It just gets worse.
There's a woman in England. She's 32.
She can't recognize her
3-year-old daughter.
It's just ... Terrifying.
This pathologist also chews gum while she works.
Oh, my god.
That's disgusting.
Thank you.
christy.
Yes. Dr. Grey is concerned that, uh, you might be
Going through with this surgery for the wrong reasons, That you might be trying to please someone
Who prefers a more ... Robust body type.
Mm. Dr. Grey.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
But even through your lab coat, I can tell, you have an amazing ass.
And with an ass like that, I bet you know what it's like
To find the perfect pair of jeans, Jeans that make you feel like
You're the sexiest person to ever put on a pair of pants.
And I envy that, 'cause I never have.
Every pair hangs off me ... Unless I shop in the boys' department.
And I have tried gaining weight, Dr. Grey.
It turns out, I'm a person
Whose fat goes straight to my upper arms and my boobs, Which makes it really hard for me to wear a sundress, Which is all I can wear, because jeans don't fit.
So, Dr. Grey, I am getting a big, juicy, Easy-to-grab-on-to ass, And you better believe, I am doing it just for me.
And I'm telling you ... I can't wait.
You are so nice.
Okay, red team's patients have all died.
Only blue team remains.
Keep an eye on Karev. That's what resourceful looks like.
good effort, avery.
But this incision you made is too wide.
You lacerated the superior thyroid arteries. Well, I just ... Move on. Damn it!
I hear it. I hear the helicopter. You what?
I- I-I-I hear it! I hear it! oh, wake up!
You don't hear the helicopter because
"a," it's imaginary, And "b," the imaginary helicopter is never coming!
Hunt's trying to break us, trying to teach us
Some b. S. Lesson about how trauma isn't fair or whatever.
We're not done until he says these dummies are dead.
The end! That's not true! No!
You are wrong!
Screw this. I'm done.
What?
Jackson!
Avery, where are you going? You ... ugh!
Avery. Avery, get back here.
No! No?
No, sir.
that should do it.
Close her up and call it a day.
Aren't we gonna get a sample from the brain? Sure, In about two weeks, when it's had a chance to firm up
In the formalin. Oh, it's possible to cut the brain fresh.
It's also possible that the moment
You cut into a fresh brain, it slides apart like jell-o.
If you don't want risk that, You put it in formalin and wait two weeks. I- I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but you ... No, that's exactly what you're trying to do, And I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you.
This is what I do, all day, every day.
I mean, do you think I
failed medical school?
Is that your actual belief, that people become pathologists
Because they fail to become surgeons?
The autopsy was inconclusive, Dr. Bailey.
And believe me, I hate that at least as much as you do.
He's stable?
He's critical.
I have to keep, uh, checking his acid-base balance, But, yes, he's stable-ish for now.
Great. So let me take over here, And you can go give his daughter an update. No, you go.
Um, tell her that his, uh, blood pressure is coming up ... She needs to hear from you. Well, he needs to be monitored.
Well, I can do that.
Okay. She doesn't need to hear an update from me.
All she wants is to make sure that I know that she's afraid, And I can't hear that right now ... because I am scared enough as it is.
I was scared when he coded.
I'm scared now that he's stable.
I'm scared walking across the lobby.
I am scared all the time.
Well, let me help you.
You cannot help! Okay? You can't help me. Dr. Altman's 30 minutes out.
We need to get him to the o. R.
Dr. Grey can help with that.
Cristina ... bon voyage!
oh, my god. It's a going away party.
You guys.
Um ... This is a party?
It's ... A busy day.
No. Yeah, I mean, I'm ... I've just been at this hospital since residency.
But, uh ... If people are too busy to see me off, Then they're too ... they're too busy.
Callie ... Well, it's hard to blame 'em, Torres.
I mean, we're down a couple of attendings.
Things are going to be busier all around for a while.
Well, I'm glad you could find the time, chief ... With all your chief problems and big plans ... Which were what exactly?
Now why would I just give away my good ideas?
Oh, he's just crabby. He's messing with your head.
Yeah, well, I'll never know, will I?
Thank you, both, so much.
Um, I-I actually have to finish up some packing.
So I'm gonna ... I'm gonna go.
Good luck.
Give 'em hell.
I- I don't want to go home yet.
You want to see us give a lady a really big ass?
Oh, my god, yes.
Sir!
You said the helicopter was gonna be here hours ago, And it's not here, and I'm not complaining, But where is it?
Well, the rain's still pretty bad.
Probably got caught in a hail storm.
no!
No! I know what that card is gonna say.
It's gonna say he has cardiac tamponade
With associated hypotension and bradycardia, but he can't, 'cause I already did a pericardiocentesis and bolused him with I. V. Fluids.
She's right.
What do I do? Do I ... Karev!
Grab his feet.
The patient!
Come on! Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
son of a bitch. That's awesome! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think you're doing?
This ambulance is not in play. Oh, you're just making stuff up, Which I can do, too! And I say it is in play.
Can't fit nine patients on an ambulance.
But two will fit just fine.
Seven of my patients may have died today, But these two won't!
'cause I'm gonna get them
On this ambulance, And I'm gonna take 'em to that hospital right there!
* "you're very handsome"
is what she said *
All right!
* oh, my, oh, my, I should've known when she said to me *
Kepner, this ambulance was involved in the accident and no longer runs. There are keys in the ignition, so let's see.
Looks like I got triple-a. Ha!
Apparently they could get here when the helicopter couldn't.
Now move!
Or I will run you down!
Let's go. Let's go.
* she shot me, she shot me *
* bang bang, she shot me *
* she shot me, she shot me, she shot me *
* bang bang *
* scorpion, she's so hot, she's a scorchin' *
* killing me softly, lauryn or kevorkian *
John doe, multiple chest and extremity traumas.
Still hypotensive despite two large-bore I. V. S
Started in the field.
All right, kepner. That's enough.
We need a full workup and likely a thoracotomy.
I suspect active bleeding in the chest.
Will you tell us we won, or she's never gonna stop?
It's not a contest. Karev!
Call the o. R. And make sure that there's a room available. Will do.
All right, all right, fine.
Blue team wins.
Blue team wins? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you win.
He's gonna live for 40 more years and have 15 grandkids. You happy?
Blue team wins! Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Here. Check that out.
"alzheimer's is a bad disease. We should cure it."
12 hours worth of work.
Dr. Stanley refuses to cut into mary's brain
Without letting it set in fixative for two weeks.
Look, I need you to go over her head.
I can't do that. She's right.
I can't speed up the process any more than she can.
That is not what you were supposed to say.
Look, Miranda, I know this has been ... A very personal loss for you, But you need to let it go.
I have to go and tell mary's husband
That I don't know why his wife died, That I can't answer
The one question he has to ask.
And I can't answer that question
Because medicine ... because science is failing me.
that I take personally.
That I can't accept.
And don't you dare stand there and talk to me about letting things go.
I'm not the one who can't stop thinking about
The possibility of his wife getting alzheimer's
Long enough to write a damn essay.
Shouldn't you be with the patient?
He's prepped and in the o. R.
And now you're gonna talk to me. Please just go back downstairs.
Cristina.
How are you fine?
How are you just completely fine?
I'm ruined, okay?
I am dead. I am wrecked.
And you're just walking around, what, babysitting me?
As if you didn't go through the same thing, too?
Why are you okay? I don't know.
You know what? You ... you were there, too, you know?
You were there, too, with your sad eyes, Screaming at me to save his life ... I wasn't ... You know, then telling the guy to shoot you and not giving a crap about yourself or your pregnancy. Cristina ... I didn't have a choice! And you did that!
If it was anyone else on the table, If it was anyone else standing there, I
would've walked away! You would not have ... I could've walked away, and then I wouldn't be here! You wouldn't have walked ... Walk with me, Dr. Yang. Tell me everything.
Now who am I gonna talk to about women?
You have Derek.
He's married and self-satisfied.
It's irritating.
Well, you can always e-mail.
What?
It's not my place. I don't ... Say it.
I give a lot of boob jobs.
Okay. not where I
thought you were going.
But I also reverse a lot of boob jobs.
Women come to me a year, Two years after they've had work done ... And they're totally unhappy with the decision they've made.
Today, though, you watched me give a lady
A really big ass, And ... and I'm not the slightest bit worried about it, Because I know for a fact, There's no boyfriend pressuring her.
It wasn't about anyone else. It was for her.
As your friend, I gotta tell you, You sound an awful lot like someone
Who's getting double d's
Just 'cause her girlfriend likes a big rack.
By "big rack," I mean africa.
I love her, Mark.
I know you do.
But you need to figure out ... How to love africa, too.
Avery.
Hey. You don't get to just walk away when I'm teaching.
Two of my friends died during the shooting, So ... Thanks.
I don't need lessons on how unfair trauma is.
I lost dozens of friends in the field ... Dozens.
And I have never ... never ... Used them as an excuse to quit.
You're a doctor, avery.
That doesn't stop just 'cause you're up against a wall.
You need to figure out how to be a doctor
No matter what you're dealing with and no matter what tools you don't have.
That is the lesson you need to learn.
You don't get to quit.
So if I need to drag you outside by the throat, You are coming with me and you are going to finish!
If his heart doesn't start beating soon, We're not gonna be able to take him off bypass.
he's back up to his core temperature.
I don't see any leaks. All the connections are right.
We're just gonna have to wait and see
If Dr. Yang's hard work has paid off.
there it is.
Nice work, Dr. Yang.
Well done.
Clamp.
And, you know, sure, there's not a lot to do over there, But, uh, that just means
Less to distract us from the medicine.
It'll just be us focusing on the medicine, which is great.
What? Oh, my god. Did you forget your passport?
I won the carter madison grant.
I won the carter madison grant.
Do you know how rare that is?
Do you know how special that is?
This is the biggest opportunity of my professional career.
I- I get to go to malawi with almost unlimited funds and help children ... help tiny humans ... Who might otherwise never see a pediatric surgeon.
I get to change lives.
That's the dream. I am living the dream.
And I am over the moon about it.
Or I-I would be, but you are ruining it for me, First with your whining, And now with your fake, smiley, passive-aggressive enthusiasm.
You are ruining africa for me. I
I'm not.
You are!
Okay.
Fine. I don't want to go to africa. Okay?
But I do want to be with you.
Okay? So I'm really trying here.
We're gonna miss our plane. Let's go.
Oh, god. Okay. You want to fight?
The flight's 18 hours. We can fight on the plane.
you're ruining this for me, And I don't want to do this.
What ... what d ... so what does that mean?
What, you suddenly don't want to go or ... I don't want to go to africa with you.
Arizona ... No.
Okay? No.
I'm sorry. Oh.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're sorry?
It's three years.
I'm gonna miss my plane.
You take care of yourself.
* ... A place I would go *
* I'm daydreaming *
No.
No!
Please. Please. I can ... We can ... we can do this. We can ... we can figure this out.
You stay here ... And be happy.
And I'll go there ... And be happy.

Do you hear me? We are over!
we are standing
In the middle of an airport screaming at each other.
We're already over.
* oh *
* now look to the east *
Dr. Altman told me about your work today.
I know it's been hell for you these past few months, So ... Well done.
Thank you, sir.
* and I stretched my bones *
Chief.
Do you have a minute?
I can't wait until the next skills lab.
I am totally on your team.
"move or I'll run you down!
" freakin' hilarious.
We're all looking for answers ...
In medicine ...
In life ...
In everything.
* and oh, if you knew *
* what it meant to me *
Oh, if you knew what it meant to me *
Were you just checking out my ass?
Not the first time.
Won't be the last.
No!
* ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *
* ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *
Sometimes the answers we're looking for
Have been hiding just below the surface.
I had the worst day today.
Been working, um ... Working on the grant proposal, And I just ... I couldn't do it.
And then I realized ... * ... For miles *
It was you.
It's a clinical trial for alzheimer's.
It's serious work, And I couldn't think of anything but you.
I know you want to be a part of the trial, But I can't have you anywhere near it.
* with only the wind whispering *
Cristina blames me.
* ... Knew what it meant to me *
* oh, if you knew *
She hates me.
Other times, We find answers when we didn't even realize
We were asking the question.
* you would see, too *
Avery, good.
Sometimes ...
The answers can catch us completely by surprise.
* oh *
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you hear? The lab ... It could not have gone better, and you should've seen kepner.
I mean, you wouldn't think it to look at her, But there is a trauma surgeon in that girl.
I wish you could've been there.
How was your day?
I quit.
What?
You were right.
I can do it. I can still be a surgeon.
I just ... Don't want to anymore.
* oh, the unspeakable things *
And sometimes, Even when we find the answer we've been looking for ...
Avery, that's enough.
We're still left

Hey, hunt, you're throwing a housewarming party tonight? Tonight? I am?
Well, your wife is. That's a good sign, right? It's a weird sign.
Well, but maybe it's an opportunity.
I mean, maybe I could talk to her. Wait. Better yet, maybe you could, Grey.
Well, we all could.
I mean, it's gonna be hard for her
To walk out of a room at her own party. How bad is it?
I'll tell you when I know. Maybe a little less party planning.
Hey, I don't tell you how to polish your sunglasses.
Look, between you and me, he's a good man.
And it'd be a shame if something like this
Screwed up what he was trying to do.
Wow. Every time I talk to you, I feel a little more relaxed.
The last thing Cristina wants is to talk to me.
I just have to give her some space. We don't have time to give her space.
She's gonna be locked out of this program, And I do not believe that that is what she wants.
I mean, do you think that's what she wants?
I'm asking you, Grey.
[ woman speaking indistinctly over p. A. ]
I still don't understand what I'm doing back here.
Dr. Webber said something about a fist.
A fistula.
It's a complication from your surgery
That's leaking pancreatic fluid.
The drain takes the fluid out of your body
So it won't go where it's not supposed to.
Okay.
Th-the pancreatic fluid
Is made to digest your food.
If it leaks in your body, It starts to digest your other organs.
Well, that wouldn't be good.
Exactly, but not to worry. Yours is looking just fine.
I just want to keep a close eye on you, okay?
Well, it seems like I just was home, and here I am again.
You know, I say that every morning. Dr. Bailey, o. R. 's ready.
Okay. Um, Mrs. Cortez, Your temperature is still a little high.
So you just rest, And we'll get you home in no time.
Okay.
Okay, you're not scrubbing in.
I'm not. No, watch Mrs. Cortez.
If the fluid in her drain changes color, you page me.
If her fever goes up one digit, you page me.
'cause the fever could be ... an abscess, early sepsis, pneumonia ... Any number of nasty things.
And remember your first rule of residency ... Eat when you can, sleep when you can ... [ both ] and don't screw with the pancreas.
[ sighs ] so much for my easy day.
Nice anastomoses.
No leaks.
How are we doing? We good?
It's not ... No, it's not quite fitting, is it? There's not enough room
In the peritoneal cavity for the graft. The liver's too big?
Uh, the baby is too small.
[ laughs ]
[ monitor beeping erratically ]
b. P. 64 over 40.
It's compressing the hepatic vessel. Sponge.
No, no, no. Larger, larger, larger. There we go.
Let's get this sponge tucked up under there, Take the pressure off the vessels, And ... Yeah, that's doing the trick there. [ beeping normalizes ]
All right. I think we're done.
But the liver's not gonna fit. We're not gonna be able to close her up today.
Just wrap her.
This happens with adult split livers.
You just gotta sit tight
Pe that the swelling goes down enough
So you can close her up. Well, how long will that take?
As long as it takes, Karev.
Thank you all. Great work.
[ monitor beeping rhythmically ]
[ sighs ] this graft is big.
The swelling ... it's gonna take a lot to go down.
How long can it stay like that, with that sponge in her?
I don't know. Isn't it just gonna start to deteriorate?
I mean, she could get infected.
And ... and what if the swelling doesn't go down enough?
The liver will die, and she'll be back on the donors' list.
Oh, jeez. How is this a solution? It's not.
[ beeping continues ]
Um, how can you not talk to Meredith about this?
She's your best friend. Ooh, I love that lamp.
You can't just cut yourself off from a person, Pretend your whole relationship never happened.
I mean, you can, But it makes you a heartless, soulless monster
Who I thought I knew, but really didn't.
With wheels on her shoes. Ugh. God, how was I okay with that?
I used to be a lot cooler than that.
I was a lot cooler when I was single.
You were hardly ever single.
[ laughing ] I know. I know.
Oh, I'm actually excited to spend time on my own.
[ sighs ]
Okay, I thought we were going to a hair salon.
Next. We're doing me now. Can I help you find something?
Yes, I will take that. That sofa?
That room. All of it. I'll take it.
Uh, you do same-day delivery, right?
Great.
[ unzips purse ]
So it went very well.
The baby looks good, liver looks good, And I think we can all exhale a little bit now.
When can we see her?
Soon. We'd like to keep an eye on her.
There's a little bit of swelling, and I want to see
That go down, but, uh, yeah, we'll let you know.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Dr. Stark.
Just ... Thank you.
Yeah, my pleasure entirely.
You aren't gonna tell them any more than that?
What would you want me to tell them, Karev? Well, that there's a chance of infection, That if the liver doesn't actually conform ... [ pager beeps ]
They could be back on the donors' list.
I mean, they're smart people.
They want to know what could go wrong. And make them more worried than they already are?
I think you're not worried enough. Tell me a better solution.
I, uh ... Can you give me a better solution?
No.

An unruptured cerebral aneurysm in his left temporal lobe.

The scan should be up by now. I swore to him, I wouldn't say anything till after the election.
I'm still not sure I should've told you.
I might be costing him everything. You're trying to save his life.
He's trying to save seven million lives, To make it so seven million people can walk the street
Without the fear of being murdered by the extremists.
He doesn't, um ... He risks his life
Every time he steps out his door.
You're trying to protect him, too, And I'm sure he'll understand that.

Yeah, we're going in on a dissected coronary artery.

From compressing her blood vessels.

Yes.
Fantastic. Look at that lady.
She's just gonna eat that pretzel.
That's all she's gonna do. So what are you gonna do?
You're just gonna become a mall person, shop and eat? This yogurt's pretty good.

Avery, how's our patient?
Oh, no change.
Oh, that's what I like to hear. I'm going into my chole.
So you ... you still don't want me to scrub in or ... no. I need you to watch ... Mrs. Cortez.
Right. Well, like I said, no change.
Avery, I need you where I need you.
I don't have time.
No, ma'am. That's fine.
I get it.
I'm saying, with this letter, there's a time frame now.
You're content to stand back and watch Cristina lose her spot in this program?
I'm saying an intervention is not a good plan.
Suction. Teddy: it's not an intervention, Shepherd.
We just thought, since we were all together ... torsades!

They're better now because I gave him a liter bolus of i. v. fluids at 20 cc's per kilo.
But his pain ... yet what you should've given him was an antiflatulent.

His pain is getting worse.
His color looks bad.
His vitals haven't stabilized. I've seen gas, Dr. Grey.
This isn't gas.
We have to give the medicine a little time to work.
We gave it time to work.
It didn't work ... Which means this is not gas.
I've worked the night shift.
I know what goes on.
I've lived through horror stories of patients falling through the cracks because residents are running around half asleep, and their attendings are nowhere to be found.
I will not let that happen to my son.
I won't either. I promise. And i agree that it's not gas.

What are you doing in the attendings' lounge?
You could get in trouble.
Pizza?
I have stupid teenage patients who superglued themselves together so their parents can't tear them apart.
That sounds romantic.
Yeah. More like moronic.
I have no idea how to get them apart without taking off half their skin.
Try acetone.
Try going away.
Meredith, any ideas?
Acetone?
Thank you.
So what's the deal with stark?
He's a lazy, a backstabbing weasel. Why?
Because I called him in to examine this patient ... you called him in?
I wish I coulda seen that. You don't call stark.
Well, my kid just had pectus excavatum surgery, and he was in serious pain.
Yesterday my fundoplication patient was vomiting.
You don't call stark.
Well, this kid's mother is a nurse at Seattle pres.
Let's play a game. There's one rule.
You don't call stark.
Alex, I'm serious. Normally i would handle this myself.
But I haven't been on peds in a while, and you know the complications with these kids.
Did you order blood work and a c. t. ?
I'd add an l. d. h. , a c. r. p. and a sed rate.
I mean, with stark, you have to cover all your bases so if you do end up calling him, he has no excuse but to get off his ass and come in.
Thank you.
Well, turns out, she was eyeing my new haircut and not me.
I gave her the hairdresser's number, though, so ... Well, you tried.
You put yourself out there.
That's what counts.
Uh, yeah, no. Actually, that counts for nothin'.
'Cause I put myself out there every day.
You know, I write online profiles, and I check the boxes that say I like hiking and dogs an ... is there a box for fistulas?
'Cause that's what I want ... a guy that can talk fistulas.
I want a guy that can direct me towards a better scientific understanding of just why a fistula may occur in patients that are healthy one minute and die the next.
Find a man that's interested in fistulas and pancreaseses, and you'll find a man that's not internet dating.
What's wrong with you?
You didn't call stark again, did you?
No. I'm not calling him until I get my c. t. results, and there's only one c. t. tech down there, and he's really backed up, so ... Have I mentioned that I hate the night shift and I hate stark?
Hey, chi. What are you doing here? It's late.
Well, when a screaming mother calls me at home to tell me my residents are about to kill her son, time becomes irrelevant, wouldn't you say?
Dr. Grey, are you familiar with Mrs. Mcneil?
She called you? I did not give her your number.
She's a nurse.
She worked the system.
But what concerns me is not how she got my number.
It's why she felt the need to call me in the first place.
Now what the hell is going on? !
I have a plan in place.
I'm just waiting for a c. t. , and the guy is just very backed up down there.
How long have you been waiting?
Two hours.
Get up.
Excuse me?
Get on your feet.
Now I understand you're a little behind schedule.
Yeah. It's just me tonight, so we're backed up.
Well, why didn't you call the on-call tech?
Well, he wasn't feeling so hot. I
thought i'd cut him a break.
He does the same for me.
Listen ... Hawk.
We're in the business of saving lives.
Now I don't care if your friend is lying in a ditch bleeding, he will come in tonight.
Now get him on the phone. Now.
Give me that.
Hello.
No, this is not your dude.
This is chief webber.
What do I need?
I need you to get yourself into this hospital in the next five minutes, or you and your dude can kiss your jobs good-bye!
Now that's how you get things done at night.
I just left lucas in surgery.
He's critical.
It's very touch and go at this point.
But we're still working, and, um, we'll keep you updated on his condition.
Thank you.
Okay, thanks.
Okay, i'll let you know.
And reilly?
Our other son ... reilly? How's reilly?
H-has anyone talked to you?
No. We've been waiting.
Okay. Um ... Okay.
Mr. And Mrs. Nash, I'm, uh, I'm ... I'm afraid ... no. No!
I'm sorry to say that ... Please don't say that. Reilly!
Please don't say that. Please don't say that.
Despite our best efforts to save reilly's life ... Reilly! Not my baby! No, no, no! God, no! No! No!
His injuries were too severe ... Not my baby!
And he died in the emergency room.
Oh, my god!
My baby! Not my baby!
I'm so sorry.
No! No. Oh, my god!
Oh, please tell me he's gonna live.
The parents didn't even know the brother died.
Not to mention how he's gonna feel when he finds out.
How do you live with yourself ... shut up!
Just shut up. Please.
Avery.
Sorry. Sorry.
I just ... thiss a really tricky part right here.
There's something ... What is this?
All right, more suction and some laps in here.
Is that a piece of the turn signal?
Come on.
It's right next to the aorta.
I can't tell if it's ... if it's kissing it or if it's ... it's perfed.
Give me some umbilical tape, and let's pull it so we can get some control.
All right. Okay, pulling.
Pulling.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait. Don't. Don't, don't.
Damn it!
Clamp. Give me the clamp.
Avery, i'll do this.
No, give me the clamp. Give me the clamp.
Here. Take this.
Got it.
I've got the bleeder. I've got the bleeder right here.
Nice work.
Nice work, avery.
So this won't sting, but as the skin starts to separate, you may feel some pain.
I feel nothing but pain right now.
Me, too.
Oh, it's your mother, lauren.
This is just gonna take a few more minutes, right?
Hopefully.
Is it working?
God, I can't look.
Please.
If we could just stay together one more day ... well, you'll definitely be together for another hour, because this ... Is not working.
Yes!
Oh, Dr. Bailey. Yes.
Dr. Bailey.
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm not here. You don't see me.
I just need a nap before I go home, but first I need some food.
Uh, this will just take a second. I've got these 2 15 year olds.
They superglued themselves together.
Uh, they're in love or whatever they think they are.
Anyway, i-i tried, uh, petroleum and acetone to separate them, but ... don't separate them.
What?
Young people need love, too, kepner.
We all need love.
If the world had more love, we could get rid of wars and fistulas.
Why won't this damn thing take my money?
Dr. Bailey, are you drunk?
Tipsy.
A-a little tipsy.
Right.
Um, you know, I'm gonna go ahead and take care of that for you.
Yeah.
Hey, Dr. Altman.
Are you available for a consult? I'm just waiting on some c. t. results.
Oh, well, joe took my keys, so I'm ... I'm pretty sure ... I shouldn't be practicing medicine.
Well, what are you doing here then?
Well, I'm killing time until joe gives me my keys back.
Can't you do that at the bar?
Cristina Yang is bartending, so, no, I can't.
It's just ... it's too depressing.
Cristina's bartending as, what, some kind of joke or ... as some kind of bartender.
Yeah, I know. That look on your face?
That's how my whole body feels, and not just
'cause Cristina makes the world's strongest drink, but because my aspirational couple has broken up, anthey're living on two separate continents, and 'cause I'm dating men who still live with their mother.
But they don't admit that on their profiles.
They wait.
They wait ... thank you.
They wait until i've spent an hour applying my makeup and driving crosstown, and then they tell me that small little detail.
Thank you.
And my star student, my most promising resident that I have ever seen, is mixing irish car bombs for a bachelor party over at joe's bar.
I'm not even gonna mention that she's letting the bachelors feel her up at will, 'cause that just adds insult to injury.
Crap. I'm ... I'm really drunk.
Pictures are up.
All I'm saying is that that redhead missed out.
If joe's were a lesbi bar, you'd have been up to your ears in ... please don't say v*g1n*.
Well, now I don't have to.
God. I hate being drunk.
You think it's gonna make you feel awesome and happy, but it just makes you feel tired and gross.
Well, Yang looked like she was having fun tonight.
What, the crazy party girl thing?
That's crap.
Every girl who climbs up on a table thinks she's the hottest girl in the room, but ... Really, she's just dancing alone.
You okay?
Yeah.
I just ... I need to sleep.
I need to sleep.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
Drew's got a perforated ulcer.
And Cristina's working at joe's.
What?
Forget it.
It's bleeding, and it must be from the anti-inflammatories.
Wait. Wh-what about Cristina?
She's a bartender now.
I called stark in and no answer.
Well, big surprise.
This kid needs surgery.
I know.
Mrs. Mcneil. This is Alex Karev. He'll be consulting on your son's case.
The c. t. scan revealed that your son has a perforated ulcer.
That's what's causing his pain.
So does he need surgery?
Yes.
And we've called Dr. Stark, and he's on his way.
We can start prepping him immediately.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so hold on.
Are we really gonna call in a whole o. r. team without an attending?
I mean, what if stark doesn't swer the page?
What if he doesn't come in on time?
What if the kid dies while we're waiting to find out?
Look, I'm taking this kid to the o. r. whether stark comes or not.
Like the chief said. This is how you get things done at night.
What if we have to do a truncal vagatomy or a pyloroplasty?
Have you ever done those on your own?
Not only can I do it.
I can do it better than stark.
Are you in or out?
Well, like hell if I'm gonna let you do it without me.
okay. Is he under?
Is he talking? Yeah. He's under.
No word from stark yet?
No.
Call him every five minutes until he answers.
And page Dr. Bailey.
Bailey's not on call tonight.
Just keep calling her.
I thought you said you could do this better than stark.
Shut up.
All right. All right.
10-blade.
It's the o. r.
uh, h-hello. Uh, d-Dr. Bailey's phone.
No, she is, um, she's indisposed ... At the moment.
Could you p-page someone else? Thank you.
okay, good.
That's good. Now give me my phone.
I need to call ben.
Who's ben?
My ex.
I dumped him, which I now realize was a big mistake, so I want to call him.
I want to call him and tell him I have needs, 'cause he understood how to take care of my needs in a way my husband did not.
I want to tell him that.
So give me my phone.
Are ... are ... are you sure about that?
Give me ... 'cause, you know, uh, drunk dialing never really ends well.
I ... you are a virgin.
Word really does travel around here.
I'm Bailey. I know everything.
Kep ... come here, kepner.
Come. Closer. Closer.
Alex Karev is not the boy you want to take your maiden voyage with.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Yes, I know. I am aware.
Uh, you don't need to tell me.
You take your maiden voyage ... with a nice boy, a kind boy, a boy who loves you, a boy that y love so much, you wanna superglue yourself to him.
You wait.
You hear me? Keep your ... Knees together.
'Cause believe me, even though you haven't met your ben yet ... You will meet your ben.
Not my ben, but your own ben ... Who might or might not be called ben.
Use soap and warm water.
On ... My maiden voyage?
On the superglue.
Oh, yeah.
Use soap, water, and put a little acetone in.
It works like a charm.
Okay. Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Salt! Salt! Come on. Here we go.
Yeah!
You want some more water?
Come on. You got it.
You know, you could fire her for drinking on the job.
Are you kidding me? I
did that three hours ago.
Take her home.
Can't. Not until she wants to go.
Why not?
Because she's got a lot of people telling her what to do, and she doesn't need to hear it from me.
So what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna sit here and drink water, make sure she doesn't leave with anybody.
Really?
That ... that's your whole plan?
Well, if she's gonna act like a stripper ... I'm gonna act like a bouncer.
Oh, god.
Dictate the op notes and monitor his a. b. g. s I'm gonna rack out.
I gotta be back here in ... god ... two hours.
I got it. Go.
All right.
Good work, avery.
Go talk to the parents.
Give them ... The good news, okay?
Okay.
You can, um, you can talk to me, you know, if you want to talk.
About what?
I hear you every night.
You know, i-I'm just saying, I had sleep problems, and they turned out to be real problems.
Yeah. Well, I don't have any problems.
That kid was practically dead when he got here, and I pulled half of his car out of him, so he lived.
He's gonna live to be stupid another day because of me.
Those parents aren't gonna lose everything because of me.
I call that a pretty great night.
So what is your problem?
Any word from stark?
No.
Here's the perf.
Anterior duodenum.
Well, we could do a graham patch.
Excellent suggestion, fellow surgeon.
2-0 silk, please, boki.
Can you believe we called an entire o. r. team and they came?
Amazing.
We've got balls. Clamp.
You've got balls. I've got cojones.
You know those are balls, right?
i was just thirsty. I
didn't wake you, did i?
Oh, no. No, I was, um ... Awake.
Water?
I want, um ... Sorbet.
Sweet tooth?
I think I have some cookies around here somewhere.
Mark.
Really?
really.
okay. I told them about the surgery and his recovery process.
Do you think I should mention his high chance for infection or ... I don't know. I don't want to worry them any more than I have to.
No, just ... Tell them he's gonna feel pretty awful ... That he lived and his brother died ... That every time he feels glad to be alive ... He'll hate himself for it.
Just tell them to look out for that.
He won't want to talk about it, but ... He'll be glad they know.
All right.
All right.
Under the cover of darkness ... people do things they'd never do under the harsh glare of day ... Yeah. Nice.
It's not as bad as it looks. It looks pretty bad.
Yeah.
Hey, thank you for calling. I
appreciate you staying, Shepherd.
Good night.
Cristina.
Oh, my god. It's my boyfriend.
Husband. I'm your husband.
Right.
Sorry, dude. She's all your come on.
Come. Come on.
All right.
Good night.
Oh, good!
You're awake.
Indoor voice, please.
Of course.
Um, you know ... I really appreciate you opening up to me.
I mean, you always have that, like, super-serious Dr. Bailey face on.
I coul't even tell if you liked me, but now, I mean, well, i-i don't know if i'd say that we're friends exactly, but, I mean, sort of. I
mean, don't you think?
Dr. Kepner.
Yeah.
This ... Never happened.
This ... Never ... appened. Got it?
Say the words.
This ... Never happened.
Never happened.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Decisions feel wiser ... People feel bolder.
What can stark do?
I mean, we had to operate.
He can yell. He will yell.
It doesn't matter. You know, the kid's in good shape, the mom's happy.
We did what we were trained to do.
Remember the first day? The chief said only two of us would make it.
I thought it would be me and Cristina.
How are we the last two standing?
I am gonna make your lives a living hell.
And you know what?
I'm gonna enjoy it.
You lied to my patients.
You hijacked an o. r. you preformed a surgery that you had no possible business performing, and for the life of me, i-i-i don't know what you were thinking.
Medicine has a hierarchy for a reason.
If there had been a complication, you know whose ass would've been on the line here?
Mine! Not yours. Mine!
You doctors in this residency, you think you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.
I've got some news for you.
I am the attending! You are the resident ... But when the sun rises ... You have to take responsibility ... For what you did in the dark ... I had to use soap and water.
What?
The acetone didn't work on the superglue till I mixed it with soap and water.
I could use a little soap and water right now. I feel disgusting.
I can smell you from up here.
Dibs on the shower.
I want a beer. Who's up for a beer?
Where are you gonna get a beer at 6:00 a. m. ?
At home.
And face yourself under the cold, harsh ... Light of day.
Water?
Oh, no.
Good morning.
Good night.The first 24h after surgery are critical.
Every breath you take, every fluid you make Is meticulously recorded and analyzed ... Celebrated ... Or mourned. But what about the next 24 hours?
So you and Cristina are going fishing?
Whose idea was that?
Owen's concerned about leaving Cristina alone, So when I told him I was going fishing ... Right, but you haven't actually spoken to Cristina?
Actually, I have.
You spoke to her? When?
I called her last night. Well, she must have been drunk or something, Because she doesn't do the wilderness.
I mean, there aren't even any bathrooms in the wilderness. Look, I know you're concerned about her, But I also know that there's nothing else
We can do right now. But you can?
because if fishing is your big plan
To get her back to work ... we're not trying to get her back to work.
We just want to make sure she's okay. Well, she's not okay, And she's not going to be okay until she gets back to work.
I know Cristina. She needs to work.
Meredith ... Well, I mean, she's not gonna show today.
I mean, she may have agreed to it last night, But in the cold, hard light of day, There's no way ... * hey, boys and girls *
What happens when that first day turns to two ...
And weeks turn into months?
Hey, you wanna do it real quick?
Nothing says good morning like shower s*x.
Look, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, Because the s*x with you has been ... Great, But ... It just ... It just makes me miss arizona.
The s*x with you just makes me sad.
Oh, no. That came out wrong. sorry.
No, I get it. Yeah?
Last night when we were doing it, I was thinking about lexie. I was thinking ... I'm gonna need some more consonants?
When we were having s*x, you were thinking about lexie?
Okay, now that's just rude. Well, you just said having s*x with me makes you sad.
'cause I'm amazing. I know. That's why I suggested the wake-up call.
Just get out.
Seriously. Get out.
* it's christmastime *
* whoa-oh, whoa-oh *
Now I'm missing lexie even more.
What was that?
Nothing. I am amazing!
* whoa-oh *
* it's christmastime *
Uh, let me give you a hand with that.
Thanks.
Hey. Bye.
Thank you.
What happens when the immediate danger
Has passed ...
When the machines are disconnected ...
And the teams of doctors and nurses are gone?
Well, I-I should go.
Cristina.
There are no bathrooms ... Out there, you know?
I know.
Surgery is when you get saved.
But post-op ...
After surgery ...
Is when you heal.
But what if you don't?
Captioning provided by abc studios, abc, inc. , And brought to you by ford. Drive one.
You're removing a gallbladder from someone's mouth.
I mean, no incision, no scar. It's like you were never there.
I ... sorry. I'll stop talking.
You want to do one of these?
Is that a trick question?
The ... the trick is, how bad do you want it?
Um, wh-when I was little, I wanted a pony ... Like, really, really wanted a pony.
This feels a little bit like that.
Good, 'cause I'm having a contest. grabbing the gallbladder.
Now each of you is researching
A different protocol
Aimed at trying to eliminate fistulas, But it's taking too long.
So this is the incentive.
The person whose protocol leads to the fewest number
Of post-operative complication
Gets to pull a gallbladder out of a mouth.
There she is.
Beautiful.
All righty. May I be excused?
I am checking on my patients every two hours, and it's time.
Go ahead.
* happy, happy christmas *
Uh, may I ... may I be excused, please?
Uh ... me, too? Go.
*
Hmm.
You're a mad genius.
If I was a genius, I'd have rid the world of fistulas by now.
Good morning.
morning.
How's Cristina?
She's fine.
She's fishing.
she's fishing?
Why?
Ask him.
Have you got any better ideas?
No.
No. See ya.
*
* merry, merry christmas *
how do I look?
I'm about to propose to my girlfriend.
So besides the gown, and the I. V. , And the ghostly pallor
From being in the hospital for the past week, What do you think, do I have a shot?
She'd be a fool to say no.
* merry, merry christmas *
Good luck.
* happy, happy christmas *
Hey, can either of you use me today?
I'm supposed to be with stark, But he wants to work with someone else. Ouch.
The guy's an ass. Maybe heartlessness is a peds thing.
No offense, but your girlfriend leaving town really screwed me.
I mean, I'm happy for the children of malawi and all ... yeah, no, you should be worried for them.
Right now she's making them fall in love with her.
"oh, I'll uncleft your palate, "I'll unherniate your hernia, I'm here for you.
I'm yours." yeah, and then someplace better will come along ... mm-hmm. Peru or india ... and suddenly she's all ... "I know I was helping you and I made you all kinds of promises, but ..." "but I gotta go."
"yeah, have fun with stark."
Hi.
Hi.
I miss you.
Mark. What, you're saying you don't miss me?
Pretty much what I'm saying.
You seeing someone?
Yes. His name's andrew rabb.
He had a tumor removed from his pancreas three days ago, And I'm trying to make sure he doesn't develop a fistula.
Go. Cure fistulas. Or fistulae.
Fistulas.
I miss you.
Okay, two minutes out.
So, uh ... You ever go fishing with Derek?
I'm a surgical resident.
When would I have time for that?
You get a day off now and then.
I spend my days off here, where she should be. Meredith ... What are your plans for her for tomorrow, Bowling with Bailey, cooking class?
I'm not sure, but, uh ... Bowling with Bailey ... that sounds fun.
Trina paiz, 27, stable.
Only complaint is a lacerated ear.
Pretty amazing considering she fell 100 feet into a ravine.
Apparently her husband broke her fall.
Jason paiz, 27 ... jason!
Grey, take her to trauma two. Is he okay?
b. P. 70 palp in the field. please. He has to be okay. He has to be okay.
Started two large-bore I. V. S ... okay, trina, do you know where you are?
A hospital I-in Seattle.
I ... I don't know the name. I'm not from here.
I'm here on my honeymoon.
My god, my husband ... Dr. Hunt is excellent, so he's in good hands.
Do you remember what happened?
We were hiking up this mountain, And we wanted a picture, So we handed our camera to some guy.
And ... We posed ... We kissed.
No, we were kissing, and then ... The next thing I know, I'm looking up at the sky, And then we're on the ground or ... Jason's on the ground, and I'm on top of him, And ... Please tell me he's not gonna die.
He can't die.
Wife is stable. Nervous, but ... she should be. His abdomen is distended, And he has a lot of internal bleeding.
Systolic's 60, Dr. Hunt. pressure's dropping.
let's get him to an o. R. Now. Watch that line.
Quickly. all right. Let's move.
Grey, no time to scrub. Come on.
Gown me.
on three. One, two, three.
See if his type and cross is back yet.
In the meantime, get me some f. F. P.
And some factor vii up here.
Drape him. Good. Okay.
Let's go. 10-blade. 10-blade.
I hope no one is wearing new shoes.
more laps.
Ugh! Ohh.
Laps! Laps!
Grey, I can't see anything. I'm suctioning.
Suction's too slow. Use your hands. Another suction.
How's his pressure? 79 over 40.
He's like a bucket full of holes.
I'm gonna occlude the aorta at the hiatus
Till we can get his pressure back up.
How many units has he gotten? Three units of o-neg, one unit a- positive type specific, And one unit of f. F. P. Okay. Let's get some more packs in there.
Let's try and isolate this bleeder until we figure out
What we're dealing with. Laps. More. Keep 'em coming. More.
More. Quickly. Faster. I don't want to have to keep asking.
Can I make a suggestion?
Yeah.
If you mount the rod holders mid-ship, We can both reach the rods from either end of the boat.
After you called last night, I did some research.
I didn't want to be anything less than seaworthy.
Well, it's a lake.
Still.
Uh, actually, it's, uh ... It's a great idea.
You may need clip-on mounts to clear the gunwales.
Are you gonna be like this all day?
I can't help it.
I've tried to avoid getting a new hip
Because I just didn't want to deal with the recovery, but ... There's no cartilage left, bone spurs. Our daughter's an orthodontist in sarasota.
Hmm. Sheila.
What? They should know that we have
Medical people in the family.
We're not just nobodies off the street.
Mr. Cherkovsky, clearly you need a new hip.
Now I've had a lot of success with a new, Minimally invasive technique. Dr. Karev.
Well, she'd use computer guidance
To avoid any excess radiation.
And she'd make a small incision along the muscle ... So we would avoid damaging the hip muscle.
Now I can fit you in this afternoon at 2:00 p. M.
And have you walking out of here by the end of the week.
Why does she have an opening? Why isn't she busier?
What my wife wants to know ... I- I heard her. I'm ... I'm standing right here.
Um, actually, I'm just coming off of some leave, And so my schedule's flexible.
But, uh, I'm the only surgeon in the northwest
Doing minimally invasive hip replacements.
Ask her why no else is doing it if it's so great.
Because they can't, and she can.
Tell them you want a second opinion. Sheila ... No, no, no. You know what? Actually, your wife's right.
It's always a good idea to get another opinion.
Call dan miller and see if he can squeeze them in right now.
Maybe I should mention
That their daughter is an orthodontist. Yeah, they're gonna meet with miller, Hear about his 6-week recovery period, And coming running back. Keep my 2:00 p. M. Slot open.
We're gonna be replacing ron's hip.
Hey, morning, eli. Hey.
Um, did you send Mr. Rabb's sample
Of pancreatic fluid to the lab yet? Not yet.
Uh, I asked for it over an hour ago. Yeah, I was letting him rest.
He didn't sleep much last night.
Dr. Grey, check out Mrs. Kay.
day three post-op, no fistula.
Already walking right away, eating right away, Isn't that right, Mrs. Kay?
Can I go back to bed now? I'm tired.
One more lap.
terrible.
Okay, there is no evidence that shows
Getting patients up faster makes any difference at all.
How's it going with your protocol?
It looks like you ... okay ... added just another medicine
To your drug regimen there, huh?
Yeah, I mean, Well, if you call octreotide
"just another medicine."
So you're still, uh, sticking with the little list?
Yeah. Standard post-op protocol
With a checklist I've developed for accountability.
Oh, my gosh. So you know what?
When I was little, I- I wanted a pony, too.
And do you know what happened?
I, uh, I worked really hard and I got one.
Mr. Rabb probably can't sleep at night
Because you're letting him sleep during the day.
Get the fluid sample now.

*
Hey. How'd it go?
Hey. Uh, not so well.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Nah, I don't blame her.
I was proposing for all the wrong reasons.
I mean, I liked her and all, But what I liked most about her was her p. P. O.
you don't have insurance?
Capped out about three operations ago.
I've been charging it on my credit cards.
Do you mind if I look at your chart?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
I'm warning you, though, it's pretty scary stuff.
Just saying.
*
Wow. Um ... You have von hippel-lindau disease.
And you have been hospitalized for over 200 days
In the last three years?
Lot of good memories.
Dr. Webber's your surgeon?
Not for long. They're discharging me today.
You have a pretty dangerous tumor on your adrenal gland.
They're not gonna just throw you out on the street.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
Look, I don't know how much your fee is, uh, but ... but I know I can't afford it.
*
I heard you just got married.
How'd you meet your husband?
Uh, we worked together.
There was a no-dating policy at our firm.
Oh, my god.
You're doing great. Keep talking.
he kept asking me out, And ... He's just like that.
You tell him he can't do something, It just makes him want to do it more.
Sounds like my kinda guy.
And then there was this work bowling party, And ... We were both waiting in line
To return our shoes.
And ... He just kissed me.
And then I was like,"okay, I need to find a new job,"
Because he was a really good kisser.
Is.
He is a really good kisser.
his b. P. Is still 70.
With all these lap pads, it should be better by now.
His pelvis and his spleen look clean.
Has to be his liver. Try a pringle maneuver.
Let's see if we can stop this bleeding. Okay.
Keep going. Okay.
Damn it. Damn it. That's what I was afraid of.
His vena cava is torn. You can let go.
Dr. Hunt, what are we doing?
this is ... this is a lethal injury.
he's on his honeymoon.
pressure's still dropping. 60 over 40.
Dr. Hunt, what do we do?
Dr. Hunt?
Dr. Hunt, what's your plan?
You have to have a plan. We can't stand here and do nothing while this guy bleeds out.
If you don't have a plan, then ... okay, 10-blade.
here you go. It's a long shot, but if we crack his chest, put in a shunt, And bypass the blood flow trying to get to the heart, It'll give us time to make the repair.
You don't get to talk to me like that in my o. R.
If you can't keep your problems ... Our problems ... outside, then you should go.
Bone saw.
What is this? Wait. Don't tell me?
Crankbait ... best used in muddy water.
Oh, I know.
Quiz me.
Is this a spinnerbait?
You know, the fish can hear you.
Did you read about that in your research?
fishing is supposed to be quiet.
is this a spinner bait?
I'm not quizzing you. I'm fishing.
you're no fun.
Maybe we should move the boat
Over to the other side of the lake.
No.
This is a good spot.
For tanning maybe.
Is this typical?
I mean, to go for hours without a bite?
Well, the only thing predictable about fishing
Is that it's unpredictable.
Wow. That's deep.
Yeah. Why don't you ponder that for a while ... Quietly?
Ird squawks ]
Okay, I pondered it, but the thing is, Is I don't agree with the basic premise.
Okay, assuming a lake has fish in it, Which this lake does, and assuming that
You're using the right baits and res, which we are, You should be able to predict getting more bites tn, um, Like none an hour. You know ... Which leads me to believe that the fish are elsewhere, Like ... like over there, or over there, or over there.
Right, and if you were over there, You would scare them away with your incessant chatter.
Fishing is supposed to be quiet.
And it's supposed to involve catching fish, Which we could do if we moved the boat
To where the fish are ... are ... are sleeping or ... or eating ... Just stop. Stop talking. Stop worrying.
Stop thinking. Stop.
Can we ... can we ... can we just ... Can we just try it my way, please? No.
I can't stop.
I can't turn my mind off.
Yes, you can.
But ... You can.
Just fish.
do it pro bono.
Look, henry needs long-term medical care, And the hospital just can't afford to take that on. Oh, so we do nothing?
No, we treat him with drugs and we schedule
Regular follow-ups at the clinic.
Well, you might as well do nothing.
Look, I wish I could treat him. I really do.
But my hands are tied. That is a load of crap.
I have seen you bend the rules around here.
If I was Bailey or Shepherd, I'm sure that your hands wouldn't be so tied. Dr. Altman, that enough.
I'm sorry.
Cristina Yang is fishing today.
She is one of the most talented surgical residents
I have ever seen, And she is fishing instead of operating, And that is partly my fault.
I just want to do something good today.
Make it up, pay it forward ... whatever you want to call it ... I ... I just need to do some good.
*
I'll ... Set up a meeting
With the review board.
Thank you.
Look, they met with Dr. Miller three hours ago.
Give it time. They're not gonna call 'cause they're idiots.
Hey, where are you going? I'm going up to miller's office
To tell 'em what idiots they are. No, they're gonna call.
All right, now you're just being stubborn. Yes, I am being stubborn.
I am stubbornly choosing to believe
That sometimes people make sane decisions, Like having minimally invasive surgery when it's available.
I am stubbornly choosing to believe that
Not all people are evil and bad and leave me in airports.
Ings and buzzes ]
hmm.
told ya.
Good. The shunt is in. Secure it inferiorly.
Umbilical tape.
here you go, doctor. Uh, now we're gonna fix the I. V. C.
I'm gonna lift the liver only enough for you
To gain access to the tear. You're gonna let me sew?
Are you questioning my judgment are you saying thank you?
No, I just ... Thank you.
Good. So ... One stitch at a time.
Slow and steady. Ready?
Okay. 3-0 prolene, boki.
Mm. Anybody want my soup?
It's reminding me of pancreatic fluid.
Oh, mm-hmm. Then I definitely want it.
Sparkle.
That was the name of my pony.
Dr. Kepner, your patient, Mrs. Hathaway just came into the e. R.
She's in septic shock. C.T. Showed a fistula.
Dr. Bailey wants you in o. R.
2 right away. No. Mrs. Hathaway?
We just discharged her three days ago. She was fine! Hmm.
And then there were two.
Um, eli, I need another sample of Mr. Rabb's fluid.
Uh, that's gonna be tough. I took the drain out.
You what? Well, with the drain in, He can't turn over, which means he has to sleep on his back, Which means he isn't sleeping, so ... okay, just call radiology. We have to put it back in.
I need to be able to see the fluid
To tell if there's an infection. Well, I can tell by looking at it that it's not infected.
Just call radiology. Look, if Dr. Bailey wants it put back in, then I will.
No, she's in surgery. Well, then it'll have to wait.
Fine. Okay. You know, I'll ... I'll do it myself. You're not touching that patient.
Excuse me?
You have your list, but I have 12 years of experience
That tells me that putting that drain back in right now
Could actually put him at more risk for infection.
12 years, I've been here ... 12 years.
Now you residents, you come and go, But this is my home, and you are my guest.
And right now, you are no longer welcome.
What's the emergency?
Oh, uh, I need a favor.
A nurse hates me.
You're a resident.
I'm sure all the nurses hate you.
Yes, well, they love you. I think you love me.
Fine. Okay. Whatever.
Can you please just talk to him, Smooth things over, so that when I go to take
My patient back to radiology and get his drain put back in, He doesn't make a scene?
Fine. I'll talk to him.
But you gotta meet me at joe's tonight for a drink. You are unbelievable.
That's why you love me, 'cause I'm unbelievable.
You and I, we don't work, okay? We-we've been through this.
One drink.
Fine. One drink.
Oh, god. Okay, there he is.
Eli?
E ... Two drinks.
Fine.
Fine. Stay here.
Eli. Yeah.
you got a second?
Oh, listen, I don't know what's going on here, But I know better than to mess with you on your turf, So do me a solid. Mm-hmm.
Nod, act as if we're having a big debate here, 'cause Dr. Grey over there, She agreed to go out with me if I talk to you.
She's bossy. I know. I dig it.
Mm. What's in it for me?
Seahawks, Sunday, box seats.
Parking?
Of course.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Unless Dr. Bailey herself orders that drain put back in, I ... Now mention how highly I think of her.
I don't care if you think Dr. Grey is the best resident
You've ever seen come through this program. Mm-hmm. I understand.
And I respect that. Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, I did what I could. What time do you get off?
What? ! That's it. You didn't do anything.
See you tonight.
You're going out with Sloan tonight?
One drink, and then you are gonna interrupt us and tell me that there's a medical emergency.
Well, there might be a medical emergency
If you don't get that drain back in your guy.
I'm just sayin', I guess you can observe
When I'm taking out that gallbladder
Through a dude's mouth.
Dr. Hunt, I updated Mrs. Paiz and checked your calls.
Uh, Dr. Marshall from n. Y. U. Called
About speaking at their conference, And the lab called with results for your kidney patient.
That it? N- nothing from my wife?
No, that's it.
You ready?
Lifting the liver.
Dr. Miller can't fit ron in for three weeks, And we called our daughter in sarasota, And she said maybe we should wait, But ron wants it, and I-I just want what ron wants, So, um, tell her, ron, tell her we want this 2:00 slot.
Oh, yeah, I wish I could, but I'm ... I'm already booked.
No ... no, you're not.
Yeah, I am. Yeah. I have that, um ... Fused knee thing.
Right, right, the guy with the knee.
Yeah. You know, let me see if I can, uh, Switch some things around.
I'd really appreciate it.
Oh, what if I push that down to later?
No, you're gting that award tonight. You can't miss that.
Oh, that's right.
Shoot.
Okay, you know what?
I'll do ron, and then I'll just be late for the dinner.
I am so sick of those awards dinners anyway.
It's like ... Waka, waka, waka. thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks.
Eli.
Dr. Bailey, have I told you lately
How much I like your eyes?
D ... I am not in the mood. Why did you remove the drain?
Because it was ready to be removed. Now I have to put the drain back in.
And write you up. 'cause that ... You said you were gonna write ... write him up. Let me handle this, Grey.
Okay, Mr. Rabb is not sleeping, doctor. That's a problem bec ... okay, I feel for him, But this protocol isn't just about him.
I don't do protocols. I treat patients.
Eli, save your high-and-mighty routine for someone else.
Now I'm sick of all of these post-op complications. I te post-op complications more than you do, Dr. Bailey.
I do. They're time csuming. They're messy.
They make it difficult for me to check up
On my fantasy football team as often as I'd like, So I make sure that my patients don't get them.
I mean, you know you're happy when I'm working.
And it's not just because of my pretty face.
It's 'cause I'm good at what I do.
Well, think about it. When's the last time you had
A post-op complication with one of my patients? Hmm?
Good work.
I think I can get another stitch in.
We can't risk it. There's too much pull on the liver.
I'm lowering it. I want to try.
No. There's not as much blood in the field as before.
He can handle another stitch. Remove your hand, Dr. Grey.
Just another second. Don't ... Done. I got it. I ... lower the liver.
Get out of my o. R.
What? I did it. Look. See? He's fine. I'm not gonna say it again.
Nstrument clatters ]
No, I just got kicked out of the o. R.
Because I'm just so sick of all of this.
I'm sick of her not talking to me.
I'm sick of you two pretending to be friends.
So put her on the phone.
Well, thank you, Dr. Keller. I think you did the right thing, Coiling the aneurysm rather than clipping it.
Thank you for the update, And I will check in with you later.
Was that Meredith?
No.
Yes.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! I think I have a bite.
Oh, my god! What do I ... what do I do? What do I do? !
Oh, my god! What do I do? ! Stay calm. Stay calm. Sit down. Sit down.
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god. Okay, okay. I'm sitting down. All right, good.
I didn't read the part where you ... What ... what to do when you catch a fish. Okay, let it run for a second.
What does that mean? ! What does that mean? ! Stay right there. Sit down.
Okay, okay. Let it ... let the fish run a little. Let it ... let it ... Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Give it some ... just give it some ... there it is.
Okay, okay. Now what? Give it some line. Let it go. Easy. Let it ... Yes. Let it tire itself out.
Okay. Easy. Now reel it in.
Reeling it in. Okay. Good, good. Good, good. See, you're fishing.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! I'm fishing!
I'm fishing! aah! you're fishing. Whoa!
Okay.
you're good.
Yeah, well, tell that to stark.
Stark? Please. You don't need stark.
You know why?
In a year, everyone's gonna want this surgery ... Except there's only one of me.
Unless ... I create another me.
That could be you ... The guy me.
Not as pretty, not as good, but close.
I could teach you if you want.
Screw stark.
stark's loss is my gain.
Okay, ron, here comes your new hip.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Uh, guys, give us the room.
Yes, doctor.
I knew what I was doing. I knew I could do that second stitch.
And you knew I could do that second stitch.
And if it were anyone else, you would've let them do it.
But because I question how you handle Cristina
You chose to slap me down and let everybody know who's boss. You want to know what I think?
I think you're reckless.
I think you're reckless with your own life, And today, you were reckless w.
And I don't care who you are, I don't want that in my o. R. , And I do not want that around my wife, Who is struggling just to hold on.
Your wife is struggling just to hold on
Because you married her
And let it be okay for her to completely fall apart.
What is Cristina gonna do when she gets back
From her fishing trip tonight, Tomorrow, next week, next month, next year?
Because we'll all be here working, And Cristina will be ... Where?
I don't know. Oh.
I don't know, but she has the right to figure that out.
You don't know. Well, I know, Because I know Cristina Yang.
And she needs to work, Because surgery is who we are.
You told a guy with a gun to shoot you.
That is who you are. What the hell does that have to do wi ...
You ... you are fearless, and I don't mean that
In a good way.
Most people don't tell the guy with the gun to shoot them.
Most people are like Cristina. Most people are afraid.
So what she needs isn't what you need.
She isn't you ... Meredith.
Well, he's right.
His patient records for the past three months
Show a post-op complication rate way lower than the norm.
Wait, 12% compared to 42%?
Yeah. Wow.
Okay, can you two stop being impressed by him?
It's a fluke. He's mean.
Hand me those charts. I think he's kinda hot.
Can you say that about a nurse? No.
Okay. Oh. Day three.
Day ... Three.
Day three.
Yeah? What?
day three?
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, okay, deep ... deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
Ooh, yes.
Dr. Bailey? Okay. Okay.
Okay, should we be following her?
A medicalert bracelet?
That's your solution?
If the patient has a hypertensive crisis ... When ... When he has a hypertensive crisis ... The paramedics will bring Mr. Burton here, And we'll treat his emergent condition.
Yso you're sending him home he'll beto die, But you're okay with it because you're giving him
A bracelet with his name on it. Hey!
Um, if we remove the drain on day three instead of day five, We can reduce the formation of fistulas by 30%.
See, uh, eli took out a drain when he wasn't supposed to, And I was gonna write him up because he can't do that, But he did.
Uh, I'm going to leave the files for you to look at.
Oh. Uh ... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm ... Miranda Bailey ... The doctor who cured fistula.
That's right. I said it.
Uh, jonas salk ... he cured polio.
Miranda Bailey is going to cure fistula.
th-th-three. Day three.
28 ... Pounds.
That's one of the biggest we've had this year. Ah, look at that.
Wow. Nice fish.
Thanks. You want a picture?
Oh, definitely. Definitely. Take a picture. Come on.
Let's take a picture. All right. You pick it up, I'll get the camera.
oh, my god. How am I supposed to pick it up? You just pick it up and take it off. You can.
It's very slippery, so be careful. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Hold it up like that. All right? Ready? Great. Yes, yes, oh, god. Oh, my god. It's totally heavy.
Okay, ready? Your friend's first time out, huh?
Yeah, first time. Yeah, she really is something.
yes, she is. She really is.
Okay. Smile now.
* it was *
* the first *
* snowflake to fall *
* before the storm *
Well, that's okay. We don't need a picture.
Take it. Let's wait till she's ... Take it now. We're gonna want to remember this.
* each one is special *
* in its own little way *
* and that first little snowfla *
* is still special to me *
oh, my god.
Jason, honey.
We were able to repair the damage, But the next 24 hours are crucial. But he can recover, right?
If ... if everything goes okay, he'll fully recover?
We're just focusing on getting jason through the night.
I know it's hard, But try not to think too far into the future.
I'm afraid to touch him.
I know right now all you can see
Are the machines and the damage, But he's still there.
Hey, there's my star resident.
Come on. We're drinking. I'm buying.
Oh, dude. Sorry, I can't. Why not?
Stark ended up hating the guy who assisted him today
Even more than hhates me. oh, god.
Anyway, there's a midgut volvulus, and I'm gonna assist.
You're going back to stark?
I mean, the guy's a douche, and ... and hips are cool, But you know ... just go.
I'm still awesome.
I've prescribed alpha blockers and set you up in our free clinic.
You need anything at all ... Call me.
We're gonna see you through this.
Thank you.
Hey.
Um ... I tried. I'm sorry. I, uh ... I'll be okay.
Dr. Webber slipped me some free samples, So I'm good for a while.
Good. Good.
Well, good luck.
I have great medical insurance.
way to kick a guy when he's down.
I'm saying, I'm ... I'm ... I'm saying that I'll marry you.
Uh ... That's a really generous offer.
But I can't.
I'm a doctor.
I took an oath, And I can't leave you now
Any more than I could leave you bleeding out in the street.
This is absurd.
You're aware of that?
And you're gonna regret it deeply in the morning.
You're dying.
Henry, you're dying, And you don't have to, 'cause I can help.
I mean it.
I'll marry you.
I want all post-op drains
Removed on day three from now on
Unless I tell you otherwise.
Do y know what this means, what you did?
what? What?
uh ... I was wondering if you wanted
To go out with me sometime, Dr. Bailey.
I mean, even that shocked, "oh, my god a nurse just asked me out.
How the hell do I get out of it? " expression
You got on right now is pretty cute.
Fine, Because you gave me day three.
And because I'm very handsome.
Yeah.
I know I agreed to have a drink wi you.
But as I walked here, I realized how unfair that was.
You know, it's ... it's ... it's unfair to you, It's unfair to me, because ... Really, nothing has changed.
I- I mean, you're ... you're still
In a very different place in your life
Than I am, and ... and you want different ... The goal of any surgery is total recovery ...
To come out better than you were before.
Some patients heal quickly and feel immediate relief.
* ... Mother and child *
Oh, lexie. I just got a page.
Bailey wants us back in the I.C.U.
Can you deal with it, please?
* tender and mild *
I have 21 pounds of trout.
How was it?
* sleep in *
* heavenly *
It was good.
* peace *
* silent night *
For others the healing happens gradually.
And it's not until months or even years later
That you realize, You don't hurt anymore.
Do you think Cristina's gonna be okay?
Mm. Yeah, I do.
* ... The sight *
Do you think she's gonna be a surgeon?
* glories stream *
Honestly?
I don't know.
Mm.
* christ, the savior ... *
So the challenge after any surgery
Is to be patient.
Mark, did you forget your keys?
Okay, so picture this ... I'm in africa, and everything's great, And the people are so nice, and the clinic is amazing, And I'm doing work that actually feels important.
Like, I can ... I can actually see that I'm making a difference, But I'm crying, like, constantly.
And then this guy that work with at the clinic
Finally asks me what's wrong, And I say that I miss my girlfriend, Like ... like, I really miss her. So then he asks me
If I want to go back if they could replace me.
And ... and then I open my mouth to say "no" ... but what comes out weirdly instead is "yes."
And so they did.
And then I came back.
* love's pure light *
You look really pretty.
But if you can make it through the first weeks and months ...
If you believe that healing is possible ...
* from thy holy face *
Then you can get your life back.
* with the dawn of redeeming ... *
But that's a big if.To a degree, medicine is a science.
You spend 6 hours on a boat.
Yes.
And you talked about fishing?
Yes
For 6 hours.
Pretty much, yeah.
Derek.
What you want me to say? We went fishing, we talked about fishing.
I want the whole story.
It is the whole story.
She caught a fish and cry is not the whole story.
Except is is, the story. This in fact the entire story.
I'm ovulating.
Ugh.
But I would argue that it's also an art.
I mean, you stole my best friend, and it's not okay.
It's not okay for the two of you to hang out like I don't exist.
I am not hanging out.
I am trying to help her.
By hanging out with her.
We gonna do this or not?
I'm too mad to even look at you.
Well, then roll over.
Fine.
The doctors who see medicine as science only?
You don't want them by your side when your bleeding won't stop or when your child is screaming in pain.
You look different.
You seem better.
I feel better.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
So you got plans?
I think I'm gonna explore the city today.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
You know, I've never had time to do it before ... or the interest.
Hello.
Teddy, you're doing what?
The clinicians go by the book.
The artists follow their guts.
Nope.
Oh. You're gonna make us late.
Okay.
Okay.
Go. Go.
Nope.
The artists feel your pain, and they go to extremes to make it stop.
You sat here all night?
Um ... well ... no.
I just flew in from Africa, so I went to a hotel and took a shower, got some sleep, and came back really early.
Really, please ... go back to Malawi.
Extreme measures ... that's where science ends and art begins.
We can do this another day if you want?
No, no. I mean, no, we're here now, and ... and ... and he'll be here.
Hey. Oh, hey, my witness is here.
Okay, let's get this thing started.
Teddy, you're not seriously gonna do this.
Yeah, I am.
Henry Burton.
Owen Hunt.
Okay, then. Will you be reading vows or do you just want a standard ceremony?
Oh, crap. Uh, it's work. Um, I'm just gonna let it roll.
Standard ceremony?
Well, maybe if you could just skip to the end.
Sorry. I'm ... I'm just ... I'm really late.
Excuse me. Can you direct me to the space needle?
It's your, uh, first time in Seattle, huh?
Um ... sure, okay.
Yeah. You're just gonna, uh, you wanna go west on Union about, uh, eight blocks or so.
And then you turn north and then you should ... Must be a bad accident.
Hey, that's not west.
You're ... you're going the wrong way.
I'll travel to Malawi every two months for the next three years to oversee everything, and I got a leading pediatric surgeon to oversee the day-to-day operations.
Well, Dr. Robbins, I signed a contract with a new peds attending.
It's a year-long contract. I can't eat that money.
I just don't have it.
Well, I don't understand.
So you're saying I can't, what, I can't have a job here?
Dr. Robbins, you're back.
Now that is the reaction I was hoping for.
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Robbins.
So, Karev, tell me about this new peds guy.
You're married. You married that guy.
So? You got married.
To the woman I love. You don't even know this guy.
Look, the man needed insurance.
You know, can we not talk about this please?
Not ever or not right now?
Uh, I'm thinking not ever.
Hey, what's going on?
A major Seattle-area shooting ... We have reports that a gunman has opened fire on students and faculty.
Bailey?
Bailey, fill us in.
Again, that's at Pacific College.
We now take you live to our on-scene reporter.
Students and faculty are still in the building.
I'm trying to get some answers, but what we know so far is that a gunman opened fire at Pacific College and that there are at least a dozen ... I'm sorry?
Okay. Okay. There are at least 20 victims.
I'm sorry. You can't be here. Clear the area, please.
Clear it, please.
He's bleeding out from this chest wound.
Pulse is thready, and he's bled through the dressing.
We're going priority one.
V-tach on the monitor. Any pulse with that?
No pulse. Starting C. P. R. Let's get him to the hospital.
You need to crack his chest. You need to ... Someone crack his chest.
There are 15 ambulances on the way.
Maybe more to come.
First one is three minutes out.
People ... People ... our own trauma is fresh, and we are going to have feelings today, and there is no shame in that.
What I want to say is, what we went through six months ago, they are going through right now, which makes them our brothers and sisters ... which makes them fellow travelers, which makes them our own.
So to the very best of our ability, we are gonna do our work first.
And you're gonna have your feelings later.
Grey.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Go to the pit, make sure we're stocked.
Call the blood bank ... I'm fine.
Call the blood bank.
Tell them to give us all the O neg they have.
I got a cop. Michael Fazioli.
28. G. S. W. to the right upper arm and left leg.
Okay, this one's mine.
All right, I'm on that one.
Chief Webber.
Sarge?
All right, Kepner, get him to trauma one.
Do labs, trauma series, and X-ray this leg and arm.
Okay.
This is the cop that took down the shooter.
You're kidding.
Yeah, he was on the radio.
He told me he landed a shot, and then he went down.
I have conflicting reports about what the shooter looked like, so if you could wake Faz up, get him talking?
Faz?
Mike Fazioli. He's a good kid, great cop.
One of ours.
What do you have?
Professor John Sturgeon, 48, fell out a fourth-story window, has an open skull fracture and a blown pupil.
He fell?
He helped a dozen kids out the window and up on to the roof, then he tried to go himself and slipped.
He's herniating. Get him to the front of the line.
Get him to the O.R.
You okay?
Nothing about this is okay.
Two and three are open!
15 year old, Kelly Keck, G. S. W. s to the leg and abdomen.
Abdomen rigid, systolic 75, last pulse 147.
She's 15?
Yeah. Look what being a genius gets you.
Clear trauma three and page Stark.
Right away, doctor.
Jared Swork, 20 years old, single entrance wound to the left fifth intercostal space.
No exit wound. Lost vitals in front of us.
This is the emergency thoracotomy we called in about.
You did a thoracotomy in the field?
No, I didn't.
I had to crack his chest.
Cristina ... Can you feel the lesion?
Yes, he's got a big hole in his right ventricle, but as long as I keep my hand here, I can feel a good heartbeat.
Cristina.
What? What?
You're going to the O.R. ?
She's got her hand on the hole, Owen.
I'll be fine. I'll be okay.
Bring him to two.
This artery is in pieces. Vascular clamp.
Here you go.
Your best move is to amputate that leg.
You've got no more time to waste down there.
What? What?
The artery's blown. The femur is shattered.
Torres can fix that.
I'm more concerned about her life than her leg.
And I'm sure her parents will be, too.
Look, this kid is 15. You can save this leg.
You can't just cut it off.
What I can't do is to spend any more time arguing with you.
Would you maintain pressure there?
Prep the damn leg, Karev.
Freakin' do something!
Intracranial pressure's getting higher.
Are we doing a craniectomy or a craniotomy?
Craniectomy is our best bet.
Dr. Shepherd.
Yes.
The professor's wife just arrived.
Can someone speak to her?
I'll go. I'll be quick.
Yeah.
You paged me?
Yang?
She was at the scene.
Oh, I was at the scene.
He's got a tear on the right ventricle.
And there could be torrential bleeding once we get in, so I just, uh, just wanted a little backup, just a little extra backup.
She's not sure if I can handle it.
I'm ready. I'm in. I'll go ... I'll go scrub.
All right. Let's get this boy on bypass.
There?
Mrs. Sturgeon.
Yes, hi.
Hi.
Are you John's doctor? Is he okay?
He fell from a fourth-story window and landed on his head, so we're taking him to surgery right now.
Wait, wait. Surgery?
We will be removing the left side of his skull to give his brain room to swell.
Okay, I-I want to come with you.
I-I w ... I w ... I need to come with you ... Because John doesn't like hospitals.
You can't come into the O.R.
No, no, no.
See, John is afraid of doctors, okay?
So I have to be with him. Please let me be with him.
Mrs. Sturgeon, I'm so sorry, but you can't come in to the O.R.
I will come out and update you every chance I get, though. Okay?
Just, uh, excuse me.
Yes.
Hi. Would you sit with Mrs. Sturgeon?
This is gonna be a long day, and you all need to take care of each other. Okay?
Okay.
You can put in a shunt and then do a graft.
Do you even have privileges here anymore?
Whether I have privileges or not isn't the point.
Karev's right.
Karev is not on this case anymore.
Dr. Stark, please, just take the time to do the graft, and you can save her leg.
I know very well what can and can't be done, Dr. Robbins.
I have bigger fish to fry, and this was very unprofessional of you.
I am all done engaging with it.
All right. Get the hell out of my O.R. , Karev.
I'm sorry. I am unprofessional? I'm unprofess ... I ... Body block him, Karev.
Don't let him near that leg.
Ah, he's got some blood in his chest, but the bullet's not there.
It's not in his leg or in his arm. Kepner.
Um ... uh, we should put in a chest tube and get more studies to see what kind of damage we're dealing with.
Is there any chance we can wake him up while we're waiting for the studies?
We could reverse his pain meds, but it would be a pretty traumatic awakening.
He'd be in a lot of pain.
Chief, I'm getting all sorts of conflicting reports as to what the shooter looks like.
You know, kids, uh, in shock, they don't remember, but cops are trained to remember.
I don't know if there's a second shooter, if this is some kind of plot, but until I have a positive I. D. , I've got nothing.
Believe me, Faz would rather feel some pain if he can I. D. the shooter for me.
Okay, I'll reverse the meds.
Okay.
Kepner. Let's set up the chest tube.
Chief Webber, this guy you replaced me with is a study in incompetence.
Not now, Robbins.
No, no, yes, now, because Dr. Incompetence is about to hack off a perfectly good leg.
Robbins, I'm pretty busy here. What do you want me to do?
Give me privileges.
It's all hands on deck.
Of course you have privileges.
Okay. Thank you.
It's not an easy day to be the man in charge.
Torres! O.R. 2 right now. 9-1-1!
What? Where are you going?
I need scrubs.
Uh ... Okay, Bailey, can you take over for me here?
Oh. Okay, excuse me.
This is, uh, Chuck Fowler. He's 21 years old.
Zone two injury of the neck, secondary to graze G. S. W.
He has a hematoma and a C.T. angio's been ordered.
Thank you.
Okay.
How you doing, Chuck?
Who walks into a classroom with an automatic weapon?
Who does that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay, here I go.
I'm a wrestler, man. I'm all-state.
Saw or no saw, you're not getting past me.
Karev, you want to tell me what's going on here?
He's lost his mind. That's what's going on here.
He's lost his mind, and he is destroying his career.
That is what is going on here!
Check it out, Torres.
15 year old, G. S. W. to the thigh with comminuted femur fracture.
Laceration to the superficial femoral artery. Ha!
All right. What about her nerves? Are her nerves salvageable?
Kid was moving her leg before we put her under.
They're intact.
She has a life-threatening hemorrhage in her leg and multi-organ injuries in her abdomen.
Abdominal bleeding is under control for now.
Thanks so much, Dave. I appreciate the support there.
Well, I can put in a traction pin to stabilize the femur.
Right?
And then we can use a graft to restore blood flow.
That's what I'm saying.
I have never experienced anything like this before in my life!
Dr. Stark, you're new here, but in this hospital, we take shootings personally, and I can save this leg.
So are you gonna work with me or not?
No, no, I am. Dr. Stark, I've just spoken with chief Webber.
This is my patient now.
What? !
This is ... th-th-th ... this ... Yes!
Karev, you gotta go, too.
The pit's full of kids that need doctors, and we can handle this one without you, okay?
That's cool. My work is done.
Ha! All-state, baby!
You see that bridging vein?
You'll have to compromise it if you're gonna pull the skull flap back.
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go update the wife again.
Dr. Grey, you're a surgeon, not a social worker.
You can't spare me for five minutes?
And you have a patient open on the table.
Well, that's not the whole story.
Don't start this again.
Well, the other part of the story is that he's got a wife who's panicking in the waiting room ... All right, fine. Go. Just let me concentrate.
I'll be quick.
All right. He's ready.
Look, I'm gonna push the naloxone.
He's gonna wake up and he's gonna hurt.
So talk quick, okay?
Ready.
Faz, it's Marty.
Can you hear me?
Oh, God. It hurts.
Aah! Oh, God!
Faz, I need you to describe the shooter.
Can you do that for me, bud?
Chief Webber.
Did you really approve of Robbins storming my O.R. , stealing my patient, humiliating me publicly?
There are plenty of patients to go around, Dr. Stark.
Jump in and find one.
I will not.
What I will do is to go back to my patient in my O.R ... .
Go be a damn doctor!
People are dying. Now go save a life, right now!
Just hang on. I need the info.
Okay, I understand. Excuse me ... Dr. Hunt. I'm free. Do you need me?
I'm free. Dr. Hunt.
They just found another classroom full of victims.
We're getting at least a dozen more.
Crap.
And we're out of O.R. s.
What?
We're out of O.R. s, we're out of space, and all the other hospitals are at capacity.
If any ... any of them need surgery, we're ... we're screwed.
Dr. Altman, you have a G. S. W. to the chest?
Dr. Yang.
Dr. Yang was on the scene.
She performed an emergency thoracotomy in the field.
You all right, Dr. Yang?
Yes, sir. I'm staying, if that's okay.
Uh, Dr. Yang, can you tell me what your patient was wearing
**
Uh, they were cut off at the scene.
It was, um, a green hoodie, jeans.
Is he a redhead, about 20?
Yes.
Uh, why, sir?
Send me down any bullet fragments you pull out of his body.
Chief, what's going on?
Your patient's the shooter.
Send down any bullets immediately.
They're evidence.
Okay, um ... Okay. Where were we?
You were about to reconstruct the ventricle.
Right. Right. Thank you. Okay.
Hand me 3-0 ethibond, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I can't, Dr. Altman.
You can't hand me the ethibond?
I can't.
She can't save this guy ... Is what she's saying.
He just shot up dozens of people, and this surgery is gonna take all day.
Dr. Avery.
That's taking three doctors and four nurses away from helping other people, people who didn't shoot up a campus full of innocent kids ... Dr. Avery.
I operated on Iraqi soldiers who blew up dozens of our guys.
I didn't like it, but I did it, because I'm a doctor, and I took an oath.
You're not a jury or a judge.
If there's a life to be saved, we save that life, regardless ... I'm not doing this.
No.
Anyone else?
I'm sorry.
Dr. Yang ... Are you staying?
Yes.
All right.
Okay, great.
Uh, 3-0 ethibond, please.
Oh, come on, come on. Press on the cricoid more.
I can't see the cords. Come on, Faz. Stay with me.
Kepner.
His vitals started dropping. X-rays were clear, no bullet, so I did an ultrasound.
Found blood in the belly.
Okay, we need all available surgical equipment.
Okay.
All right? Quickly.
Good.
Ready for transport.
Uh, chief. You should stay in that trauma room.
There are no O.R. s. Get the chief an anesthesiologist.
Right away, doctor.
What? I-I got a cop with blood in his belly, the same cop that took down the shooter.
You're saying I have to operate on him in a trauma room?
I'm saying, it's your best option right now.
Sir, his pressure's dropping.
Hunt. I hope you know what you're doing, Hunt.
Yes, sir. So do I.
Kepner, lock him down in there and get me a major procedures tray now.
Okay.
Avery, is Altman done yet?
Hurry, hurry.
No, and while we've got a cop bleeding out down here.
She's occupying a perfectly good O.R.
Going to extreme measures to save the damn shooter.
I tried talking to her.
Wait. Altman's guy is the shooter?
D-does Cristina know that?
Yeah. So does Altman. I walked out.
All right. Go to the emergency room. There is incoming.
Kepner, I need you to go to outpatient recovery.
I need to get these supplies to the chief.
No, no, no, no, no. Hey, you. Take this to the chief in Trauma one.
Okay, doctor.
Go to outpatient recovery right now and oversee it.
What ... what am I doing?
It's like a mobile trauma unit. It's like a mash unit.
I'll be there in a moment.
Wait, wait. Where are you going?
You were trained for this, Kepner. Oversee it.
Oh.
Okay, coming through.
I understand why you're mad at me. I do.
No.
I even understand you slamming the door in my face, but ... No. No, you will not hold me hostage and make me listen to you.
I am rebuilding the leg of a kid who's been shot.
That's ... that's why I'm here. That is the only reason.
No talking.
None.
Okay, if anyone's free, we have an incoming patient.
G. S. W. to the flank with active hemorrhage.
Why are we still accepting critical cases?
I'm coming, Kepner.
Thank you.
Uh, look, continue to debride out the devitalized tissue and repair the injured vessel.
You're serious?
What, you want to take the incoming G. S. W. to the flank?
All right, then. Just, uh, there's enough surgeons around if you have questions. Just take care of Chuck.
Okay, Chuck.
I'm gonna be doing a vascular repair on you in a freakin' mosh pit.
Oh, son of a bitch.
I. C. P. 's still 45.
His brain is still swelling.
We're gonna have to remove the other side.
You're gonna take off both sides of his skull?
We're gonna leave this strip here that covers the upper superior sagittal sinus.
Let's get the other side prepped.
Well, I'm gonna go update the wife.
Since when are you so interested in updating the wife in the waiting room than doing this?
Since I was the wife in the waiting room, Derek.
I mean, honestly, do you think you and Cristina are the only two who have ever been through a trauma?
Stop. Don't do that. Do not bring Cristina back into this.
You don't get to act like a spoiled little brat in my O.R.
Why is it okay for Cristina to do whatever she wants, but it's not okay for me, because I'm not hiding under O.R. tables or bartending?
Meredith.
I mean, honestly, you and Cristina are so busy supporting each other, have you even noticed that I went through a trauma, too?
I was the wife in the waiting room, Derek.
And it's so hard to be the wife in the waiting room, so hard that I walked into the O.R.
While the shooter had a gun to you and told him to shoot me instead.
That's how hard it is to be the wife in the waiting room.
Excuse me. I'm gonna go update my patient.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's continue on.
Dr. Shepherd is going to remove the other half of your husband's skull.
If all goes well in the O.R. , he'll then freeze the skull to keep the bones from dying, and then he'll sew the scalp and the muscle back over the exposed brain.
Look, I don't understand. I'm sorry. I don't understand.
I know it sounds frightening and extreme, and it is.
But Dr. Shepherd is very good.
And I'll ... I'll come out and keep you posted, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm looking for the Sackett family.
Anybody here for a John Sackett?
Excuse me. Is anyone here related to Jared Swork?
Yes. That's my son.
How is he? Is he okay?
Ma'am, would you mind coming with me?
Here you go, man.
Thanks, man.
My son was shot. He wasn't the shooter.
No. No!
My son didn't do this!
No, no, no.
Oh.
What the hell?
Sloan, move on.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Kick it later.
We've got a kid in three with a G. S. W. to the shoulder, and we need this space for incoming.
Fine, but my name's not going on this chart.
That's a hack job you did.
Somebody get Dr. Nelson here. Now.
I'll get Grey. You get bed three.
Mm-hmm.
Clean it and wrap it.
Right away, doctor.
She's got an intracranial hemorrhage.
Uh, her pupil just blew.
She needs burr holes and a ... and a trauma flap.
We gotta evacuate that clot.
Okay, we can do that. We can do that.
I need some hands over here, Avery.
Yep.
Arterial repair. Can you hold that?
Got it.
You know, Altman's still in O.R. 1?
So you can't choose who you save.
Yeah, that's apparently the party line.
The shooter's sick.
Nobody does this in their right mind.
What's your point?
My brother just had a psychotic break and tried to kill my sister. And if he got hurt, even if he got hurt hurting people, I would want his doctors to do everything they could to save him.
No matter what he did, he's still my little brother.
Making the incision.
Ready with the drill?
Yeah.
No. You're gonna do it.
Mark.
She's your patient, Dr. Grey.
You're gonna save her life.
Ready?
Gently.
Right there.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Damn it. He's crashing.
I need a crash cart in here now.
Hey, do not die, Chuck.
You hear me? That shooter does not get to win this.
You come back.
Here goes.
Clear.
Come on.
Oh.
Come back ... right now, Charles.
Come back to your body right now.
Clear.
You b*st*rd! You better send this boy back right now!
Clear!
Sorry about the b*st*rd thing.
There's something you need to see.
Alma mater, to you we'll be loyal and true our home in our memories, we now give to you for we love and we cherish your name throughout all the years sweet, Pacific northwest.
What is that?
The Pacific College Alma Mater.
And gold for your name and your colors.
Thank you for staying today, Cristina.
I know it can't have been an easy decision.
Know what, though?
It was.
How is he?
Well, he's decompressed, but he's got a bad contusion.
Damn it. He's bleeding too much.
Vascular clips.
We'll strive for you Alma Mater ... She's ... right there.
Mrs. Sturgeon.
Yeah.
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Hi.
Hi. Uh, your husband is in a medically induced coma.
He'll have to stay that way until his brain heals.
And hopefully, in a couple of weeks, we'll be able to replace the skull and wake him up.
Mm-hmm.
Wait. You're saying that he lived?
That he's alive?
Uh, we have a l ... long road ahead of us, but, yes, he is alive, and I can take you to him if you'd like.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, my God.
It's okay. You can see him in a few minutes, all right?
It's okay.
He made it? I told you. I knew it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Uh, has anyone talked to you about your son?
The police questioned me for hours, as if I should've known something.
They found a ... suicide note in his jeans.
And I-I didn't know anything.
My whole life ... everything ... I ever knew is a lie.
He's my baby.
All I want to know is if he's alive.
Is that terrible?
All these people he hurt ... Does that make me a terrible person?
Your son ... was shot in the chest.
Dr. Altman, who's a very good heart surgeon, is doing everything that she can.
She's still in surgery, which means he's still alive.
And she'll come find you as soon as she's out.
Okay?
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Mm.
He's fine.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. You're kidding me.
No. It was touch and go for a while, but he's gonna be fine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And, um ... Let's stop meeting like this, Marty.
Oh, please, God.
Please, God.
This is ... this is a huge victory.
You know, whatever else happened today, we worked together well, so ... thank you.
Thank you for coming when I asked you to come and for fighting Stark with me.
Thank you.
Calliope.
Hmm?
I am ... so deeply, deeply, deeply sorry for hurting you so much.
I am so sorry, because I am so in love with you, and I will spend the rest of my life telling you that.
I'll apologize to you every day if that's what you need.
But please ... please don't walk away again.
I came across the world to be with you.
I love you.
Please.
You had to fly across the world to get to me, Arizona, because you flew a whole world away without ever looking back. You just left.
And this might be news to you ... you know, I-I think it kind of is ... but you're not the only one in this relationship.
There are two of us.
And you came back today, but I didn't.
Whatever else happened, that ... that ... that hasn't changed.
Hey.
Oh, you ... you've been holding everybody up even though ... You amaze me.
Mm.
I know you're mad at me for taking Cristina fishing.
And I know you think it didn't work.
I just heard she's O.R. 1.
What?
She's here.
I just took my kid to a room.
He was the last one.
Besides this one.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Besides this one.
37 degrees.
Should be any minute now.
We saw 26 patients.
26 victims ... and we had no casualties.
No one died today.
I hate this place.
Surgery is extreme.
We cut into your body, take out pieces, and put what's left back together.
I was holding a grudge.
I can hire you back.
But you're gonna have to work under Stark.
Hey.
Hey.
She's, uh, still sedated.
And she's just a kid.
She shouldn't have a big ugly scar.
Uh, do you mind waiting?
I'll be about another hour.
I love you.
So ... yeah, just, uh ... take your time.
I, um ... I'll wait.
Good thing life doesn't come with a scalpel, because if it did ... when things started to hurt, we would just cut and cut and cut.
Hey. I'm ... I'm really sorry I'm late.
You look exhausted.
You look exhausted.
I look handsome.
How about we get you some insurance?
Let's have a drink first to toast the day.
Henry ... Because I've never been married. Have you?
No.
Um ... but I wouldn't say that this is exactly a ... I know what this is. But I say we raise a glass anyway.
Look, there was no ring, right, no vows, no photographer, no wedding cake, which I was most disappointed by, because I love wedding cake.
I think we can at least have a toast, right?
I spent the day in the O.R. saving someone who really, really is, um ... not a very good person.
Well, you saved me, too.
You saved my life this morning, and that deserves a toast, even if it wasn't a real wedding.
Okay.
Okay.
The thing is, what we take away with a scalpel ... we can't ever get back.
You want to get a drink?
Yeah, I do.
Maybe not a real drink, actually, because I'm trying to get pregnant, and supposedly, alcohol will make my baby have three heads and 16 toes.
Want to get some crack cocaine?
So like I said ... good thing.No, it's gonna happen.
We just have to keep doing it until we get it right, right?
Right.
You bring you into every new beginning in your life.
So how different ... damn it.
Can it possibly be?
damn it.

Those chicks.

Since your first day here.
let's go.
sorry. When you gotta go, you gotta go.
okay, we are with Shepherd today. He's neuro.
Is he nice? Uh, he's my husband, so I have to say he's nice, But he's also a damn good surgeon. Oh, thank god.
I'm just glad you're not one of those
"obsessed with my job, but cold and dead inside" surgeons.
We have rounds.
Henry burton has von hippel-lindau disease and a pheochromocytoma.
It's extremely rare, causes blood pressures to sky rocket, And it's treated with alpha blockers. Look at that. He reads.
Sorry. Should I ... med students are like children at the dinner table ... To be seen and not heard.
Dr. Yang. Sir.
Uh, good to see you, henry.
Thanks. I, uh, wore my best gown for the occasion.
I am Dr. Bailey. I'll be working with Dr. Webber today.
I feel like I already know you, Dr. Bailey.
Eli here has been telling me all about you. E ... Don't worry. I didn't tell him everything.
Okay. I did not know that you were on this case.
Sure you didn't. No, I did ... Bailey, what ... No, sorry, sir. Um ... Wh-where was I?
Dr. Yang will run, uh, Scans, and then we'll be ready to go.
Sounds like an idyllic day.
Who's he? Nobody.
I mean, uh, he's ... He's here observing. ignore him.
Mr. Wilson's a first-year med student, And Dr. Yang is showing him the ropes.
Uh, have you told Mr. Wilson
About the most interesting aspects of the case?
He's been brought up to speed. Did she tell you that henry here
Originally was denied this surgery
Because he was uninsured?
Um, no. I mean, she didn't mention ... That.
Uh, that's too bad ... About the insurance.
Well, I got married. I'm on my wife's insurance now.
oh, congratulations.
Your girlfriend finally wised up, huh? Uh, nope.
Oh, uh ... Uh, sorry. Um, I'll ... I'll come back later.
No, no, it's okay. I've got the, uh, forms right here.
Just a few signatures, and we're good to go.
Great. Great.
Um, I'll have them back to y in a couple of hours. Great, thanks.
that's my wife.
Upgrade, right?
The ex was a cater waiter.
Dr. Torres.
What? !
Nothing.
Well, you said my name.
Just as a, you know, good-morning type thing.
Where's the stupid meat wagon?
morning, Dr. Hunt.
Doctor ... don't.
I've got the crash cart standing by!
Brady sullivan, 32.
Stable vital signs, complaints of neck and back pains.
Possible crush injuries. He was trampled by a horse.
A horse? A-a team of horses, like ... like three horses, If that helps you at all.
Please, please don't let him die on our wedding day.
Aah! Oh!
Push of morphine. We were going downtown this morning
To sign our domestic partnership papers ... There's a lot of bruising here.
And I had a horse-drawn carriage to pick us up from city hall and ... and bagpipers, because brady is scottish, And he really likes being scottish. Okay, I feel tenderness at c-6.
Get x-ray in he, stat. Brady, I am so sorry. The bagpipers started up, And they spooked the horses, and ... and they ran.
Over me. They all ran over me, kyle.
Bagpipes? All right, exam shows weakness in lower extremities.
I've got diminished reflexes. Move. I can't work.
Dude ... Sorry, sorry.
I agreed to the tuxes, but horses? It was supposed to be a surprise.
It was. okay. Yeah. Looks like l-4 and l-5 are affected.
Page Shepherd. All right, let's get him ready for c. T.
Sir, I need you outta here now. I want to stay with him. I
have a right to stay with him.
Avery, get him outta here now. Move.
sorry. Oh, my g ... okay, everybody out. Now.
Now! Before I have to take someone out.
You married a patient to give him insurance?
Have you lost your mind?
Insurance fraud is a serious offense. Actually, according to
The national medical anti-fraud association, It's not insurance fraud, it's just frowned upon.
It's highly unethical. You're a doctor, for god sakes.
The medical community is fairly split on this.
Is it more unethical to deny a patient lifesaving care
Or to marry a patient and give him that care? It can get murky. Don't you have somewhere to be, Dr. Grey?
I'm on Dr. Altman's service today. We are doctors.
We save people's lives every day without marrying them.
You marry someone you love.
Well, I love him. I do.
I mean, I love him ... So much.
Dr. Altman, this isn't a joke.
I appreciate your concern, chief, but it's done.
He has insurance, you're his doctor, And now you can save his life.
please don't tell the chief I said this, But I think what you did was awesome. I mean, I get it.
She's got a hang-up about me being perfect. You know, Everything comes easy for me, and I don't have any flaws, And now that I've clearly made a mistake, She's just gonna pound the crap out of it. so you don't think you're perfect?
No. I have lots of flaws. I'm competitive, I'm a workaholic, I smoke when I'm stressed.
It's disgusting. Well, I'm sure she'd love to hear all those, Along with any other real faults you come up with.
You were that guy on "Seattle med," right?
The one who made a trachea from scratch.
Well, stem cells, not scratch.
But yeah, that's ... that's me.
Badass.
I'm really interested in regenerative medicine. Yeah?
Mm-hmm. I'll show you a bladder we're growing in the lab
After rounds. Okay.
Ladies first.
You're her teacher, Alex.
Only for the day.
uh, sarah cassidy, 15, has a rare genetic condition
Called treacher collins syndrome ... Which caused her to be born without cheek bones, Leaving her orbital floor unprotected, And vulnerable to eye injury. Which means the only extracurriculars
I can sign up for are the ones
That don't involve things flying at my face. She rocks the chess club.
I just want play sports. You bowl, honey.
Not really a sport, dad. You, uh, you mind if I take a look?
Scoot over a little so laurel can see.
sarah, we're going to take pieces from your skull and transplant them into your face to rebuild new cheekbones.
Do you have any questions or concerns?
Volleyball tryouts are in two months. Can I tryout?
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Here are the forms. You are officially insured.
Amazing. And I have nothing to give you in return.
Wait. Are you hungry?
You want a fruit cup? Henry, you needed insurance. I was happy to give it.
Come on. Take the fruit cup.
Well, I am starving.
that's disgusting.
Yeah. I wouldn't eat it if I were dying.
I should go. Um ... Good luck with your surgery.
Thank you, Dr. Altman.
Mm.
Wow. A volleyball player. Digging into her skull will tack on
An extra year of healing, you know?
Well, maybe she'll play in a couple of years, then.
Well, did you consider the stem cell surgery
They did in cincinnati using a cadaver bone graft? Oh, it's too experimental.
I think it's worth considering given her age.
I think considering her age, it's best to be conservative.
I'll see you in surgery.
Can we, uh, go in and see the scans?
Pretty small room. Let's just wait. He's got tandem lesions, A fracture translocation at l-4 and 5, And a unilateral jumped facet at c-5 and 6.
what does tt mean? It means one of the joints in his neck
Was knocked out of place, and he's got a broken back. That one's your husband?
What? Yes. Can I just say, jackpot?
I mean, you get to be at work with that all day and go home to him at night?
I'm gonna go see where they're at.
I'm worried about his neck. I don't think
He should be intubated with a cervical injury. wel I could do a little traction.
Snap it back in before we do surgery.
hell of a wedding day. mm.
They say if you want to piss off god, just tell him your plans.
Dude, out, out, out.
I don't ... That is the biggest pheo I've ever seen.
Is it infiltrating the kidney there?
Is that ... that ... that's the spleen, right? No, that's the liver.
Oh. Okay, so is that the tumor? That's a gall bladder.
Wait. Really? Cross my heart. Hope to die.
The image is reversed on an m. R. I.
It's confusing at first.
I'm sure Dr. Yang can remember seeing her first m. R. I.
And empathize.
Empathy is a good quality for a chief resident, Don't you think, Dr. Bailey? Oh, I do, sir.
This is from the feet looking up, So that's the kidney, That's the adrenal gland, and that is the tumor.
That's the tumor? It ... it's eatg into the kidney.
Right. I was hoping we'd only have to remove
The adrenal gland.
But it looks like
I'm gonna have to take henry's kidney as well.
Dr. Shepherd will decompress
The nerve roots from behind, and then I will put in
A graft and a plate for stabilization.
But before any of that can happen, We need to move your neck back into place.
Fun. I'll be done before you know it.
Sir, you probably don't want to be here for this. No, I'm staying.
Kyle, don't overdo it. You always ... there's gonna be a lot of, um ... I'm staying. It's my fault he's here.
If he's in pain, I'll be here with him.
Stop trying to kick me out.
No, you're right. You should stay.
Hold his hand.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, brady, You ready? Okay.
Okay. One, two ... Three.
aah!
od!
So how'd my tumor look?
We don't have, uh, the results
From all the scans yet.
I've had 11 operations in the past 3 years.
I have tumors removed as a hobby.
I know how this works.
You know the results, but you can't tell me.
So give me a hint. I mean, look, Are we talking marble, grapefruit, basketball? Dr. Webber will be up shortly
To discuss the results of the scan. Come on, fred. What'd you see?
No, he's a first-year med student.
He can't even read a scan. Then why does he look like he's gonna piss himself?
Look at his face. He's sweating.
What's going on? Am I gonna die? No, I'm not ... my face ... It ... don't let me ... 'cause I'm just ... like she said, pretend I'm ... Stop talking.
What'd you see, fred? Nothing.
It's gonna be okay. Truly.
My uncle had his kidney removed, and he's ... what?
Oh, god. I'm sorry. Stop talking. Mr. Burton ...
You have to remove my kidney?
Do you? Do you have to take out my kidney?
The tumor on your adrenal gland
Has compromised your kidney.
It's enough damage that we need to remove it.
I know. It ... it sounds like a lot, But it really is our best option.
Could we ask Dr. Altman what she thinks?
Uh, Dr. Altman is a cardiothoracic surgeon.
This isn't her area of expertise.
I know, but she did this amazing thing for me.
I trust her.
I'd feel a whole lot better if I knew that she was on board.
I've got a consult waiting.
We'll be quick. Karev.
we put together some stats
Comparing the surgical options for sarah.
As you can see, this slide shows
The donor site morbidities
Associated with using sarah's own skull. Next slide.
and here you can see the pros and cons
Of using skull bone versus cadaver bone.
You can see that the benefits of using cadaver bone
Are really quite extensive ... turn the lights on.
We just got started. Lights. Now.
Mark, I know what the research says.
So there's a chance of some donor graft complications.
Complications? No.
You, come here.
We do your procedure, We'd incise here and here.
What's happening? Stand still.
There's risk of hitting brain, causing a hematoma.
Or we take the cadaver route. You avoid that completely, Which means all of this ... Doesn't even get touched.
She's a child. And that ... that procedure is experimental.
So as the lead doctor on this case, let me be clear, We're doing the surgery as planned.
You're a crappy listener.
Add that to the list. What?
Just saying, There's more wrong with you than the fact that you smoke.
I probably shouldn't have used permanent marker.
My apologies.
Mrs. Burton.
Mr henry burton.
Your husband requested that I talk to you
About his upcoming operation.
We would like to remove the kidney. Well, a man can live without a kidney ... If that's your recommendation.
Funny, because that's exactly what I would recommend, But apparently, my recommendation
As chief of surgery, with over 30 years
Of general surgery experience under my belt, isn't enough.
He would like your recommendation.
The recommendation of a cardio surgeon
Who happens to be his wife.
I see.
Yeah, I agree with your recommendation.
There you go.
This is a totally inappropriate relationship.
Totally inappropriate. You want to talk to me about inappropriate relationships?
Everywhere I look in this hospital, There is inappropriate relationships ... Grey and Shepherd, hunt and Yang, The other Grey and Sloan. Dr. Bailey's dating a nurse, taking full advantage.
Oh! I ... ignore him.
We are not dating.

Okay, I know I'm not perfect.

You want to hear what I'm saying and really take it in and try to give me what I want?
Yeah. I really ... I .
Get your crap out of my apartment.
all right, let's bandage him up and get him ready for the next phase. Kira, do you want to take a look at these sutures before ... Kira. Sorry?
Are you texting? Oh, I was just telling my boyfriend about this.
Can I send him a picture, do you think? no.
all right, everybody, take your places.
Can I help roll him over? Edward, move.
Okay, we're gonna roll him on my count. Everybody ready?
One, two, three.
Okay.
's got a junctional rhythm. Is there a pulse with that?
all right, his pulse is thready, but it's there.
he's hypotensive. Grey, hang some f. F. P. Let's push 1 of epi.
Lost his pul. Starting compressions. He could have some delayed internal bleeding.
Let's get ready for a laparotomy.
I need to get in there. Gown me. What about hyperkalemia?
All right, out. Now. I saw the monitors when you turned him.
He had p. T. Waves, then a widened q. R. S. , Then a sine-wave rhythm. Dude.

Uh, they just taught us that on Friday, so ... What's your name? Edward, sir.
Good save, edward.
Okay, tell me about your cadaver bone thing
For sarah.
Really? Look at you.
Did somebody maybe listen to what someone else had to say? Okay, I get it.
I suck. I'm a stuck-up, self-righteous bitch, And callie wants nothing to do with me ever again, But can you just drop it and tell me about the damn surgery?
we'll inject the donor bones with stem cells.
This way, the bones will grow and conform to sarah's face.
There's a much lower chance they'll degrade over time, Which is key, especially if you want to play sports.
Cool. Random dead guy's bones in my cheeks.
My teammates will call me zombie face.
but it's still highly experimental.
Jared.
Yeah, what about the original plan?
this surgery is more advanced, And would decrease the chance of complications
That could make the kind of sports that sarah wants to play
Out of the question. Well, it's just sports, honey.
You're good at other things. You paint. You draw.
Because that's all I've been allowed to do.
I'm a tomboy, but I've never been able to be a tomboy.
I know you want me to ... Draw and paint and bowl, But ... I want to play volleyball
Ansoftball and soccer.
I don't know. If you guys don't let me take this chance
To be who I really am, I'm gonna be more prone to teen depression, Eating disorders, drug addiction.
Is that what you want?
You are too smart for your own good.

Beautiful. Nice work, Dr. Yang.
Mr. Wilson, would you like To take a look at the tumor up close?
Oh. Sure. I-I mean, yes.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so these are the hilar vessels.
Our med student's gonna faint.
Catch him, people.
Thank you.
Sorry about that, sir. Ah, it's fine.
That's exactly why I like seeing first-year med students here once a year.
Reminds me where I started.
Humility ... That's another good quality for a chief resident, Wouldn't you say, Dr. Bailey?
It was always one of my best qualities.
Also, it's funny when they fall down.
Sir, you want to take a look at this.
He's doing fine. His spine's been stabilized, And, uh, he'll be awake soon.
He's fine? He'll be okay?
His recovery will be slow and painful.
You should be prepared for that.
This was supposed to be the best day of our lives.
You think I'm silly, I know ... With the horses and the ... Bagpipes.
So does he.
We don't get marriage in washington.
We get domestic partnerships.
We get to go to city hall and stand in line and ... Sign some papers.
Mail it in if you're even more romantic.
So call me crazy, but ... I-I just wanted the big day that everybody else gets.
And I fought fort.
I organized rallies, I ... Stood in the cold outside the statehouse.
I had some neanderthal throw hot coffee on me.
I fought for a wedding and waited.
And they still said no.
So when we got tired of waiting, and ... Brady and I went to go sign the papers, I wanted it to be special.
He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, And I wanted it to feel like that.
Not like some trip to the dmv.
I wanted it to be special.
And instead, I nearly killed him.
Things don't go the way you want 'em to.
Ever.
Ever.
Come on.
Let's go see him.
You paged me, chief?
We found a cyst on henry's pancreas
That's in danger of rupturing.
Removing it means removing a large portion of his pancreas, Which would make henry a diabetic.
We didn't discuss that possibility with him.
Okay.
Well, do you think that's something he could live with?
I don't know.
Well, I hate to ask you on the spot, Dr. Altman, But technically, you are the wife.
And you're also his emergency contact person, So I am asking you, Do you think he has the support system
To manage a very tricky disease?
I don't know.
Is there someone we could call? A next of kin? Anyone?
I-I don't know. You signed a marriage license, And you haven't asked him the most basic questions
On how he wants to live or die?
Do I have your permission to act as I see fit?
Yes.
That's all, Dr. Altman.
So ... Did you get my note?
Eli.
I guesyou got my note.
What do you think?
I think you're dirty is what I think.
You want to be dirty with me? Show me those on-call rooms
You doctors are always having s*x in? I'm going home.
Mm. Mm.
Mm.
If you change your mind ... I get off in an hour.
whew.
I have a phd.
Um ... After college, I got a phd, And then I went to medical school, And I'm number one in my class.
I know you think I'm an idiot, but I'm not.
I-I've seen this stuff in textbooks.
I-I've just n-never seen it up close before.
whatever.
Think what you want of me.
You want to not be an idiot?
Back up your resident, no matter what.
Never undercut them in front of their boss.
And when a patient asks you for information
You're not allowed to give them, Stall or say you don't know.
Just wait long enough until the attending gets there.
The attending takes the lead.
And if you ever panic
Or feel faint in an o. R. Again, Just ... Stop thinking, There's a body open the table in front of you.
Just stop thinking and take a deep breath.
It usually helps.
Wow.
Now I feel like an ass.
Just disregard my evaluation.
What evaluation?
We turned in evaluations on you guys.
What did you say?
Um ... I might have used
The word, uh,"heartless."
Among others. There were ... Check the monitor.
Thank you, doctor.
Okay. Lay it on me.
Lay what on you?
The speech.
You know,"the chief is right and what you did
Was totally inappropriate" speech.
Oh, uh, the speech. Yeah.
Um ... Okay, I not dating a nurse.
We are not dating.
But we are having ... Fun.
I mean, I-I look at him, And he's ... Pretty.
But there's no future.
He's just ... I mean, I-I would not have him to my house
Or introduce him to my child, Because who knows what he would do.
He left a dirty note for me in a chart.
Now what if ... what if the chief
Opened the chart and ... and found the ... It's inappropriate. That's what ... that's what he is.
He is inappropriate.
But I'm-a go with it.
Mm.
Because, you know ... Why not?
That's my attitude these days.
Why the hell not?
a cadaver bone doesn't have
Any bone growing cells or proteins in it, Which is why we're drilling holes in it.
Would you like to hold it?
what do you think you're doing? Teaching.
Dr. Karev, do you really think it's appropriate
For someone with so little experience
To be handling these cadaver bones? Relax.
Karev, kepner's right.
Your student's allowed to observe. That's all.
Stubborn, passive-aggressive, uh, I resent obligations.
Just tell me when I'm getting warm here.
I choose her over you in the divorce.
You know that, right? Of course, of course.
That's because you two have been friends forever, And you and I are like siblings.
We fight. We get on each other's nerves.

There was a large cyst on your pancreas.
When they got in there, It was necrotic and close to rupturing.
They called me to make a decision
Because you listed me
As your emergency contact person.
And what did you decide?
They removed a large portion of your pancreas, Which means that you might be
An insulin-dependant diabetic
For the rest of your life.
It's gonna be
A very big adjustment for you.

And I say, practice makes perfect.
♪ afraid of the height ♪
I bail. Okay?
When things get hard, I-I walk away, And maybe it's because I grew up an army brat.
We moved every 18 months.
Maybe I never learned to commit.
Bui'm here now, and I'm staying, Because I'm gonna fight to make sure
That you know that I'm committed to this thing.
Now I-I'm not perfect, but neither are you.
And you ... you want to talk about faults?
How about not being able to forgive?
At some point, you're gonna have to forgive me.
And it may as well be now, Because I am ilove with you, calliope, And you are in love with me.
And all I'm asking for is one more chance.
It's all anybody wants, right, Clean slate ... A new beginning?
You want another chance?
Yes. More than anything, I want another chance.
Like that's gonna be any easier.
K the guy pushing the boulder up the hill.
Nothing's easy about starting over.
Today I found out that I pregnant
With Mark's baby.
How about now?
Nothing at all.Doctors practice deception all the time.
We give vague answers to hard questions.
We don't talk about post-op pain.
We say,"you'll experience some discomfort."
John Driscoll, white male, 62, Alzheimer's diagnosed eight months ago.
Patient number one of Alzheimer's N. G. F. clinical trial.
If you didn't die ... we tell you,"the surgery went well."
But the placebo has to be the doctor's greatest deception.
Okay, you're gonna hear a ... a little drilling sound.
How you doing, John?
Okay.
Great. You're doing great. All right, envelope, please.
Half of our patients, we tell the truth.
The other half ... we pray that the placebo effect's real.
Okay, John, we're gonna insert the probe now.
And we tell ourselves that they'll feel better anyhow, believing help's on the way, when in fact ... we're leaving them to die.
You have to say something.
Words. Make words.
Holy crap.
Yep.
A baby?
Growing like a weed in my uterus.
Not like a weed.
Like a mighty oak.
We're gonna be great parents.
Mark, you ... you don't have to do ... Are you kidding?
That's my kid in there.
I'm a dad.
We're parents ... of a baby.
Okay. You're in.
Should we get married?
Oh, no.
No, I mean, I'm all for raising a baby with you, but, uh, there's a line.
You're right.
That's good, 'cause I'm in love with Lexie, and it would be ... Oh, my God. Lexie.
What am I gonna tell Lexie?
Okay. You think about that.
Are you ready to talk now?
I want to say some not nice things, and I want you to listen without saying that our relationship is over or walking out.
Okay.
I'm mad that you slept with someone else.
And I know that we were broken up, but still, you slept with someone else.
And I'm even madder that that person has a pen1s.
And I know that you're bisexual, I know that ... Okay, would you rather I slept with a busty redhead?
'Cause ... You have to give me a chance to process this, okay?
I am processing.
I didn't plan this, okay?
I-I ... I didn't plan any of this.
But there's a ... mighty oak or whatever showing up in our lives in about seven months, so ... now I have to plan.
And I don't know how long I can wait for you to process.
But I ... I want you ... in my plan.
I want you to be a part of my plan.
So ... are you in or are you out?
Uh ... I'm in.
I'm in, but you have to give me ... You ... I'm just ... I'm s ... I'm still ... I'm so mad at you, so you have to give me a minute.
Okay.
By injecting methylene blue, it's easier to identify the structures.
What do you see, doctor?
Gallbladder ... Cystic duct, common bile duct.
Yes. Misidentification of the anatomy ... is the main cause of biliary tree injuries.
Today we're trying this new technique ... Put those things away, people.
No texting in my O.R.
Save that for the drive home.
Um, actually, we're not texting, sir.
Dr. Bailey's performing a toupet procedure right now, and there wasn't enough room in her O.R. , so we're just following it on Twitter.
Twitter?
What the hell is a Twitter?
I booked the O.R. I read up on the procedure.
I know this thing better than my own name at this point.
I pre-rounded on the patient, and her pre-op labs are all done, and ... Wow. Quadruple bypasses are exciting, right?
First assist gets to sew all the grafts on to the heart.
Plum job.
I want it!
It would be an honor.
I know you're thinking, whoever does this gets a leg up in the race for chief resident.
But do you want to know a good way not to get it?
That's to bug the crap out of me before my day even starts.
I'm sorry. I'll back off.
You know what? Actually, I'll go to the skills lab and practice my grafts.
And you just let me know if you need anything at all ... Yang took the chart. She took the chart? What ... What did Arizona say?
Well, she said she's in.
Well, that's good, right?
Oh, I'm still hedging my bets.
I'm not gonna move back in with her until I know for sure she's not gonna bail again.
Hey, you got dinner plans tonight?
No.
I'm cooking for you tonight, your place.
I rocked a lap chole.
Mm. Mwah.
So when are you gonna tell her?
Not until after my home-cooked meal.
Mark, you do not have to do this.
I am giving you a "get out of jail free" card.
No hard feelings. You ... you can be the cool uncle that hangs out on Sundays.
I'm not the cool uncle. I'm the dad.
You love Lexie, and the last time a Sloan kid appeared in Seattle, she dumped you.
Now if you were the cool uncle ... I'm not the cool uncle! Don't ever say that again!
Okay.
This is my kid. I want this kid.
Cool uncle ... Well, so tell her.
Do not wait until this kid comes out looking all sloany.
You didn't say good-bye this morning.
I had a surgery.
Mm. I didn't want to wake you.
No, you were starting your clinical trial, and you feel guilty that I'm not on it, so you snuck out.
You're right, but I don't feel guilty, and I didn't sneak out. Uh, patient number two, Daniel Cobb, admitted and in a room.
His wife has some questions for you.
I can't believe ... Mm.
He picked you for this thing instead of me?
Well, Dr. Shepherd didn't want to leave anything to chance.
Now you can both go to hell.
Meredith, it was open to all the residents.
Karev just did a better job of pitching me.
It was open to all the residents except for one!
Ugh!
You having a good day, Daniel?
Yes, I am, Dr. Shepherd.
You give me that new wonder drug of yours, I'll be even better.
Well, if it came down to how much I like the patient, you'd be a shoo-in.
Now if Daniel gets the drug, how soon will he stop slipping in and out of things?
Well, at this stage, we don't know any more than you do, Mrs. Cobb.
That's why we're gonna do a 2-year follow-up.
And the idea that his condition could be reversed altogether, is that completely out of the question?
Because I-I just read that when the drug was used on rats and monkeys ... Mm-hmm.
There was some reversal in tissue damage.
That's rats and monkeys. It could be different for humans.
Well, I don't want to rule out a reversal altogether.
But right now, we're trying to stop the progression.
All right, Dr. Karev is gonna take you down for an M.R.I. later, so if you have any more questions today, page him.
I'm feeling better already, Dr. Shepherd.
Here we go.
Here we go.
A clinical trial's a little different than a regular surgery.
You can paint a rosier picture.
Yeah, I-I didn't want to give 'em false hope.
You didn't give 'em any hope. Look, if Mrs. Cobb thinks this is gonna give her husband a better chance, she'll be a better caregiver, and in the end, he has a better chance of success, okay?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Is that all you're having?
Yeah, I think so. Um ... Mnh-mnh. Chief, this is my milkshake time.
Milkshake time is not a thing.
You didn't bother to tell me that you were broadcasting surgeries.
Oh, I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
Well, it is. What if something goes wrong?
Look, the patients who want to do it sign a comprehensive release.
And the nice thing is, most of them want to do it.
They're excited about being on the cutting edge.
Until they code on the table in front of the whole world.
In which case, I'd stop tweeting.
In the meantime, residents from all over the country get to see a surgeon's decision-making process.
They get to ask questions live.
It's a great teaching tool.
No, it's lawyer bait. Shut it down, Dr. Bailey.
Sir, if you understood it, you'd be on board.
I understand it fine.
Uh-huh.
I understand it, Dr. Bailey.
If you say so.
I do say so.
Don't give me Bailey eyes.
I'll ... look into this tweeter thing.
But no promises.
Uh, does this mean I get to tweet in the meantime?
No, it means give me a chance to look into it.
Hi. What's going on? How's your day going so far?
Good. I've got a cabg later this morning with Avery and Yang, who have officially entered into the rabid dog stage in the race for chief resident, which could be a good thing or it could be a-a bad thing, which I ... You really aren't interested in my day at all, are you?
I might be having Mark Sloan's baby.
Oh, good lord. He got to you, too?
Callie is pregnant with Mark's kid.
It's while we were, you know ... I love Callie, and Mark ... You know, is human and clearly has good genes because he's both pretty and smart.
And I want to have a kid, but with Callie.
I'm not sure that I want to have Callie's kid with Mark.
And so just ... can you say something to me that will make me want to have Callie's kid with Mark?
Um ... I gotta go.
What happened?
I might be miscarrying.
You're not miscarrying.
Well, then it's an ectopic.
Could it be a blighted ovum?
It's not a molar pregnancy, is it?
Wow. We got a lot of doctors in the room.
Who the hell are you, and what are your credentials?
Lucy Fields, Harvard M. D. , Duke ob-gyn resident, and now maternal-fetal medicine fellow at Seattle Grace Mercy West. Damn good at my job.
Who the hell are you?
We're, uh, we're related to the ... Oh, uh, that's, a-a ... It's a situation.
Lesbian lover, baby daddy.
Ah, and everybody's a little wigged out.
Okay. So ... There's your baby.
There is the yolk sac.
Looks good. You're good.
I'm bleeding. I ... It's not uncommon.
Happens in around 30% of all pregnancies.
It's probably fine.
But I-I don't see a heartbeat.
Where's ... where is the heartbeat?
Oh, well, it's probably too early for that.
I'll do blood work, but I'm pretty sure everything's okay.
Just take it easy for the next few days, drink a lot of water, no tampons, no intercourse.
Sing it.
Uh, call me if the bleeding gets worse or if there's pain.
Otherwise, go live your life, all of you, while you still can.
Martha Elkin, 75, multi-vessel coronary disease confirmed by an angiography.
Here this morning for an off-pump cabg.
That's just doctor speak for a quadruple bypass.
Oh, thank you.
Pre-op labs and her x-rays were normal.
Okay. You're ready to roll, Martha.
My husband went down for some coffee.
He wanted to know how long I'd be asleep after the procedure.
Well, Martha, it's hard to tell.
Every patient reacts differently.
Uh, but we'll keep him posted.
Most patients wake within 90 minutes.
Oh, that's helpful, dear. He'll be glad to know that.
We ... we're both so nervous.
Well, some anxiety is completely normal.
But let me ... reassure you.
Dr. Altman is an incredibly talented surgeon.
You're in the very best of hands.
Um, Martha, I'd like to ... give you my cellular telephone number.
Now you or your husband, if you have any questions, if he gets a little worried or wants an update, then he can call this number.
I'll even make sure to have a nurse answer if we're in the O.R.
Oh, you're wonderful.
I mean, you all are.
This is the finest patient care that I have ever seen.
I feel like a-a V. I. P.
Well, it's just what we do.
Hey. How long are you gonna be in there?
Oh, I've gotta put on a localizing frame.
At least an hour.
An hour?
Yeah, give or take.
Dr. Shepherd wants me to be as thorough as possible.
No! I'm not doing this without my wife.
Sir.
No!
Mr. Cobb, your wife is right here.
That's not my wife.
Mrs. Cobb. Look, it's your wife.
That's not Victoria.
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.
Daniel, it's me. It's Allison.
You're not Victoria.
It's Allison.
You're ... you're not my wife. You're not Victoria.
It's Allison.
I want Victoria. I want my wife.
It's Allison.
Get away from me!
Sir, who is your wife?
I don't know. I don't know.
Sir?
I told you. It's Victoria.
I want Victoria.
Is she here?
No.
Do you know where she is?
I don't ... I don't ... I don't know. I don't ... I don't know.
Okay, okay. I ... Well, I'm gonna go find Victoria for you, okay?
I'm gonna go look for her.
I'm gonna find her and bring her to you.
You sit tight. I'll find Victoria.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Do you know who Victoria is?
Victoria is the woman he loves.
They met at the home last year.
Mm-hmm. One day he asked me to wheel her towards him.
And that was it.
I watched him fall in love with her.
Well, Ben and I watched.
You're Victoria's husband?
Until she leaves me.
Oh, she's not gonna leave you, Ben.
We'll see.
Victoria was diagnosed with vascular dementia.
It's not Alzheimer's, but it might as well be.
She's like Daniel.
When she's lucid, she knows I'm her husband.
When she's not ... I go from being her husband to, uh, somebody that gets to hear about Daniel all the time.
Daniel can still be in the trial, can't he?
This doesn't mean he can't do it?
No, he can still do it.
The rule for the study is, uh, we need his consent.
Once we have it, it's okay if he's not always lucid.
You don't have any more openings, do you?
Unfortunately, the trial is only for Alzheimer's dementia.
There's no chance?
I'm sorry.
This is seriously jacked up.
Mayo clinic says "good luck."
Cleveland clinic sent you a whole bunch of smiley faces.
And there's a resident from Sydney, Australia, joining us for the first time. Yay, Sydney.
Turn it off, Grey. Chief's orders.
Oh, but this is Mr. Windsor's third operation.
Everyone wants to know how it comes out.
Okay, until I get the okay from the chief, we're not even gonna tweet the time of day.
I mean, it's ... it's not like the chief even reads tweets.
It's not like he'll know.
Drop it, Kepner.
I understand. He's the boss.
A-and I'm sure that he's got his reasons.
But you've also got 3, 000 residents out there who have been by your side this whole time, through a couple of ... of very difficult, time-consuming, life-threatening operations.
And now to tell them forget it, just like that?
It ... it ... it ... it's like ... It's like turning off the TV when Clarice is knocking on the door of the house.
It ... it's silencing the lambs, and ... and ... and the lambs want to scream, Dr. Bailey.
The lambs ... want to scream.
The man would never know.
No. No, the man would not.
Want to know what's really fun and not at all depressing?
Alzheimer's research.
Callie's having my baby.
What?
Right?
Best news of my life.
At least it would be, except for the fact that Lexie wants a baby about as much as she wants a root canal.
I-I guess I could tell her I'm the baby's uncle.
But I don't want to be the cool uncle.
The cool uncle's only cool till the kid's, like, 9, and then the cool uncle's just creepy.
I'm the dad.
I want this ... And I want Lexie.
I don't know. What ... what do I do?
You're the man with the answers. What do you think?
How could Meredith and I try for months and not have any luck, and you look at somebody, and a baby appears?
Sloans are unusually fertile.
You're a classic example of failing up.
Not exactly the advice I was looking for.
Well, you got it. Cheers.
She okay?
Yep.
Maybe.
I said,"yep." Yep is not maybe. It's yep.
She paged us.
I paged you.
Callie hasn't left the exam room since you were last here two hours ago.
Well, what if it is a molar pregnancy or ... or a fetal demise or an infection? I mean ... She doesn't seem to want to leave the exam room until we rule out, what, everything?
Well?
Callie ... I'm bleeding!
I don't want to take any chances with this baby.
All right. What if we run a culture?
Just in case. Can't hurt, right?
Sure. Can't hurt.
Good idea?
He followed me through a snowstorm.
Sorry?
In college.
Daniel saw me in the student union, and he followed me to my class in a snowstorm.
Introduction to French Poetry ... It was in this big lecture hall, and he sat there for an hour and a half twice a week for five months, just trying to get up the nerve to meet me.
That was 40 years ago.
Please.
Give my husband the drug.
Mrs. Cobb ... You could do it if ... if you wanted to.
You know that you could.
No, I-I couldn't. It ... it's completely random.
The computer decides.
We don't even know if he's getting the drug until we're about to inject it.
Well, then change it if you need to.
I need my husband back. I need Daniel back.
I'm sorry. I just ... Even if the drug worked, uh ... It's not gonna reverse things.
But I-I can live with that. I-I can ... I can live with what ... what ... what we have right now.
I can live with being a part-time wife.
But I cannot live with losing my husband all the way.
So ... for God sake ... give him the drug.
Please.
Day one, and this thing already blows.
You got one guy begging us to get his wife in the trial, then this other guy's wife wants me to steal the drug for her husband.
Well, you're the one who wanted in on the trial of the century.
Yeah, but with peds, the problem's right in front of you.
I mean, sick kid, worried parents.
Here, you ... you've got a sick parent who doesn't even know they're sick.
Well, about five years ago, I was visiting my mother.
And she starts telling me how she thinks she's got herpes and how she doesn't want to go to the hospital and get checked out because she's afraid everybody will know.
So I realize that she thinks
I'm her best friend from med school, and it's 35 years ago.
So ... I had to just sit there and talk to my mother about her possible herpes for two hours, two very long hours.
I couldn't cure her Alzheimer's, but at least I could give her what she needed in that moment.
Advice about herpes?
Advice about herpes.
Oh, you may want to put all that away, Mrs. Elkin.
They're gonna come take you to the O.R. any minute.
I don't think it's such a good idea.
What, the ... the surgery?
Well, it's risky, isn't it?
I mean, it's a 5% chance of mortality?
Yes, but ... that's a 95% chance of success.
Those are good odds.
I've had such a wonderful life.
My friend Donna, she had a big operation like this, and she was never the same.
Nursing home, couldn't even feed herself ... It was terrible.
The poor kids, it was so hard on them ... Such a burden.
I ... I don't want to do that to my children.
I know it's scary.
And it can go wrong sometimes.
But you could have 20 more years.
I mean, y-you ... you could go to this baby's wedding.
Are you sure you want to give that up?
If you walk out of here right now, you could have a few months, maybe a year.
But you'll always be wondering when you're gonna go.
And your family ... they'll always be watching you, terrified.
Don't give up on yourself.
Let us help you.
Will you be there?
Every step of the way.
Okay.
I'll do it.
You'll be great.
Unbelievable.
You think you're gonna be able to do the grafts just 'cause the patient's requesting you?
Altman doesn't exactly fall for that kind of crap.
Believe it or not, not everything I do is about competition.
Yeah, as if ... 9-1-1 means you're dying! Somebody has to be dying!
Well, what if the baby was dying?
There's nothing wrong with the baby or you!
You can't page me in a panic every time you have a feeling!
Don't yell at me.
I am a hormone casserole.
My body is not my own.
And something feels wrong.
Is it muscular?
No, it's a feeling in my gut.
In your uterine gut?
No, my metaphorical gut.
Thanks.
Arizona said she's still in, but she said that before, and then she left.
I don't think she's going anywhere.
She loves you, Torres.
Yeah, well, what about Lexie?
What are you gonna do about her?
She's your soul mate or something, and she's gonna freak the hell out.
Everything in my life is always a disaster!
I really don't want this to be a disaster.
I-I don't even want to move or breathe.
I don't wanna do nothing.
I don't ... What if I do something and it messes this baby up?
Martha Elkin's blood pressure was slightly elevated, but I let her rest and then retook it, and it's, uh, fine, so it should be no problem.
And tweedledum is here, too.
Charts are updated.
Did you decide who's gonna be first assist?
Why would I decide now?
Patient care has never been better.
I mean, once I choose, one of you is just gonna be skulking around like a surly teenager.
Okay, this should be an easy choice.
I have been practicing these graft attachments every day for a month.
Some of us don't need to practice.
Sure, Yang. You've got more experience overall.
But these last couple of months, you haven't exactly logged a lot of hours in the O.R. , have you?
That's not ... You really had to go there?
You're that insecure?
No.
Just that much of an idiot.
Damn it.
Can I help you with something there, chief?
I'm trying to look at Bailey's tweets on the Internet here.
I think you mean "tweets," sir.
Well, whatever.
No, no, not whatever.
It's important you get that one right.
Uh, let me try.
Bailey's putting her surgeries on the Internet for the whole world to see.
I told her I'd look into it, but I think it's a terrible idea.
Well, I don't know. It might be a good way to reach students.
Yeah, or it might be Bailey bragging to the world about Bailey.
This thing isn't designed for medicine.
It's designed for gossip.
For now. I mean, look at GPS.
It was designed for the U. S. military to keep an eye on foreign troop movements, and now it's in everyone's car.
You know, you go out, you never have to get lost again.
Yeah, I don't go out.
We'll just save that conversation for next time.
There you go. Bailey's Twitter page.
It looks like she's tweeting a surgery right now.
What? !
So that's why we also had to do a left hemicolectomy.
Here's a question from ... Dr. Bailey.
I specifically told you not to tweet your surgeries until I looked into it.
I-I'm sorry, chief. I misunderstood.
I thought you said I could tweet until you decided.
Don't play dumb. That's not what I said, and you know it.
Put away that little toy.
Oh, he's hemorrhaging. The blood's coming from ... I-I don't know where it's coming from.
Okay, hold on. Let's see.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, we've got a pseudoaneurysm in the splenic artery.
How did that ... what ... what happened?
Uh, pancreatic enzymes are leaking into the abdomen.
They're dissolving the blood vessels. Clamp.
You need to get the spleen outta there.
I'm already on it. Clamp.
Anyone see any more bleeding?
No, but what's left of the pancreas is still leaking.
We need to take out that whole thing.
You know, it's one thing to live with half a pancreas, but to remove the whole thing ... His life's gonna be hell.
Grey, put that damn thing away!
This is exactly what I was talking about.
Grey.
It's Walter Reed. They suggest an islet cell autotransplant.
No, that's for pancreatitis.
You don't do it with trauma patients.
What is it exactly?
You isolate the cells from the pancreas and inject them into the liver.
They trick the liver into acting like a pancreas and ... and making Insulin.
Yeah, when it works. You need an awful lot of cells.
You ... you know, just because it isn't done for trauma doesn't mean ... I know. I ... but even if we wanted to, we don't have the equipment to extract cells.
We need a ricordi chamber.
We don't have it, but Northwestern does.
How do you know?
They can get it on a plane and have the equipment here in six hours.
Well, that's ... It's too late.
He's ... he's too unstable.
Okay. Okay. H-h-hold on.
Denver, um ... Tacoma methodist. Yes, they've ... they've got it.
Tacoma ... uh, we take out the pancreas, I get on the helicopter to Tacoma with it, I'm back in 90 minutes, you manage in the meantime.
Let's do it.
Okay, tell them.
She's wigged out, okay?
She won't say anything.
I think it's my fault.
Well, what did you do?
We were just both busting each other's balls.
We're both on the same surgery, and I may have said something about her flaming out.
Hey. Hey.
I want Owen.
Go find him.
What the hell ... He is gonna be running around for the next hour while I sew grafts on a quadruple bypass.
Owen's at the dentist. He'll be hard to find.
You are evil.
He started it.
Now this is the hard-core machine.
The highest resolution there is.
Thank you.
Now it's almost impossible to find a heartbeat until the eighth week, even with this thing.
In fact, I don't even have moms come in until the eighth week because they come in, they don't see a heartbeat, and they freak out, and they camp out on my exam table all day.
But since you already camped out here all day, it can't hurt to have another look, right?
How's he holding up, Dr. Knox?
Ph is good. He's normothermic. Stable.
Um, a ... resident at Hopkins wants to know why they don't normally do islet cell autotransplantation in a trauma patient.
But we're not tweeting, so ... Um ... in a trauma, the pancreas is usually too damaged.
You can't get enough cells.
I ... got another question from ... Emory.
Mm. Go ahead.
Will you use the portal vein to inject the islet cells into the liver?
Mm. Yes, but it's a little tricky.
The portal vein is partially dissolved because of the enzymes.
Ooh! Good answer.
Oh, this is a message for you.
It says, uh,"hi, chief Webber."
"Dr. Neil Lefkoff, university of Miami."
"I was a resident at Seattle Grace"
"eight years ago."
"It's a pleasure to be scrubbing in with you again, sir."
Neil? Really?
Well, I'll be.
Okay, we've placed the octopus tissue stabilizer.
Now what?
Dissect out the L. A. D. , nick the artery, put in a shunt, and put the graft in distal to the blockage.
Okay, good. Go for it.
Dr. Avery, nice of you to finally join us.
And before we had these machines, we used to mince up the pancreas and spin it ourselves.
Dr. Ellis Grey taught me how to do that 20 years ago.
I mean, she would take the ... Okay, slow down, chief.
I can only do 140 characters at a time.
Okay, she had this trick where, after the final washing, she would ... Oh, man, what was it?
Oh, it was ... it was classic Ellis.
Oh, now what ... Oh, damn. What was ... uh, no, forget it, put a pin in it.
Uh, anyway she would take the, uh, messed up pancreas ... Nice. What do we do next?
Check the flow on the graft.
All right, Mr. Cobb, everything is looking good.
How's he doing?
Uh, he's stable. He's not acidotic or hypothermic.
How many cells did you get?
Uh, 300, 000. Is that enough?
Uh, normally, you want about a million.
But it's better than nothing.
Nothing?
Just give me a minute.
This was a bad idea.
Callie ... No, it was stupid. She said it's too early.
She can't find it yet. It doesn't mean a dead baby.
It just means this was really stupid.
Shut up.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Okay, we're almost there.
Can I have the envelope?
Okay, Daniel, I'm gonna insert the probe now.
Very good, Mr. Cobb.
Honey?
Hi. How you feelin'?
Oh, I'm okay.
I've got a slight headache.
Where's my Victoria?
Can I see her?
Mrs. Cobb, he just came out of surgery.
Look, this doesn't mean it's not gonna work.
W-we won't know that for a while.
When he acts like this, you just need to tell yourself, this is not your husband.
But he is somebody who needs your help.
So whatever you can give him ... Daniel ... I'm gonna call Victoria and get her here as soon as I can.
Okay?
Thank you.
Karev.
I couldn't have done it any better myself.
You reassured her. You got her to focus on what was important.
Ah, I'm off the trial.
What?
It's too depressing.
I can't handle this for the next two years.
You just handled it.
No, that was Meredith talking. She told me what to say.
She's been saving my ass all day.
You need to get over this thing where you're just thinking of her as your wife, because your wife is the only person twisted enough to handle this crap.
Oh, and that said, I'm in the race for chief resident, and so far, I'm kicking ass, so I'd appreciate it if you mention to Dr. Webber that I prioritized the patient's needs over my personal gain.
Take care of her.
Anytime, Martha. Anytime.
Bite me, Yang.
Uh, chief.
I just wanted to update you on Anthony Windsor.
Anthony?
Windsor.
Our pancreas patient.
Oh, oh, yeah, right, right.
Okay, what's all this?
Oh, uh, this is, uh, Ellis Grey's old journals.
I'm trying to find the answer to a thing.
Well, anyway, the islet cells have started producing Insulin.
It looks like the transplant's gonna take.
That's great. Great.
Excellent work, Dr. Bailey.
Okay, sir.
I'm doing a robotic subtotal gastrectomy tomorrow.
Now I know you wanted time to think about ... Uh, that's ... that's ... that's fine. Fine. Absolutely.
Tweet away. Tweet away.
Yeah! Yeah, yes, yes. There it is. Okay.
She would add heparin and aprotinin.
Okay, now when you're tweeting tomorrow, tell everyone that Ellis Grey's trick was to add those, okay?
Make sure you tell 'em that.
Y-yes, sir.
All right.
What are you doing? Is that one of my boxes?
Oh, don't get up. Oh, you rest.
Plus, you shouldn't be lifting any heavy things. I got this.
No, I'll get up if I want to.
Are you moving my stuff back in?
Callie ... I haven't said I'm moving back in ... yet.
I-I ... We're not together.
I mean, you can ... you can take those back to Mark's place.
Shut up. Just shut up.
You don't get to tell me that we're not together.
We are together, because I love you and you love me, and none of the rest of it matters.
We are together.
And if you ever sleep with anyone else again, man or woman, I will kick the crap out of you.
Now you sit your ass back down there, because that's my baby in there, and I don't want anything happening to my baby!
Your baby, huh?
Our baby. There was a heartbeat.
And it was ... We're having a baby.
Do I still have to sit down?
Because I'd rather rip your clothes off.
I'll do the ripping.
You rest.
Doctors practice deception every day ... on our patients ... on their families.
I am putting in tarragon.
Not that I have any idea what tarragon tastes like.
But I think when people use tarragon, it makes them seem like they know what they're doing.
Basil can't do that.
Anybody can sling some basil around a kitchen.
Callie's pregnant.
Oh, my God. That's great.
She loves babies.
Did ... did they do a-a turkey baster thing or something?
I mean ... wait a minute.
Okay, so wait. Arizona just got back, and they ... were they doing ... Wait. Was this before they ... I saw the heartbeat today.
This is my kid. This is a part of me.
Please. Is there any way that we can ... How the hell ... Did you get me in this position ... twice?
It ... it's ... it ... unbelievable.
You are unbelievable.
But the worst deception we practice is on ourselves ... My next, uh, Alzheimer's surgery is tomorrow at 7:00.
Put your name on the board.
Which is why sometimes, it takes us a while to realize ... that the truth has been in front of us the whole time.One of the hardest lessons as a doctor is learning to prioritize.
Truck.
Cabin.
Spoon.
Truck.
Cabin.
Spoon.
Very good.
We're trained to do all we can to save life and limb.
But if cutting of a limb means saving a life, we learn to do it without hesitation.
Several months ago, I asked you to remember three words.
Can you tell me what they were?
Truck.
Cabin.
Spoon.
The three words I asked you to remember, what were they?
It's not an easy lesson to learn, and it always comes down to one question ... Yes. Um ... What are the stakes?
Truck.
Cabin?
And the third word?
What do we stand to gain or lose?
At the end of the day, we're just gamblers trying not to bet the farm.
Spoon.
Spoon.
Spoon.
Excellent.
Chief.
You paged? Hey.
How's it going?
Well, the word "Spoon"
has ceased to have any meaning for me, but I'm through the first test set.
I have a few more consults today, but what's up?
Meredith ... I would like to initiate a clinical trial.
One that would be the next major advancement in the fight to cure type 1 diabetes.
Wow.
And I'd like you to participate.
But I am on Derek's Alzheimer's trial, so I don't think I can do both.
Just listen.
The basis of this trial was something that I found in here.
In my mother's journals?
Yes. She was working on islet cell transplantation when she became ill, trying to eliminate the need for anti-rejection meds altogether.
W-with her notes, drugs, and new technology, there's no way we can't take this the rest of the way down the field.
We?
Well, it's your mother's work.
I wouldn't feel right moving forward if you weren't a part of it.
You should look at them both.
Just think about it. It's your decision.
It's your birthright, Meredith.
It's your mother's legacy to you.
What is it?
It's a kale and apple juice smoothie.
It's time to think less about your cravings and more about filling that baby with nutrients, which that has.
It also has chunks. I don't drink chunks.
I want my coffee. Mark, tell the woman.
I'm allowed to drink one cup of regular coffee.
Sure you are.
Oh, w-wait, Mark.
Are you aware that there are studies that link caffeine with preterm labor, low birth weight, other birth defects?
That goo looks great. I say you stick with the goo.
Okay, you two can't just dictate
What I'm allowed to eat and drink.
Nobody's dictating anything.
But you're pregnant now, so things have to be different.
You're gonna have to eat better and take it easier at work.
And well, if it helps, we'll give up caffeine, too.
That helps no one.
Well, how about we put it to a vote?
All in favor of Callie drinking coffee, raise your hand.
All in favor of the goo.
Goo it is.
It's horrible.
It's the opposite of horrible.
Alzheimer's or diabetes?
If you continue to whine about how you can't decide which groundbreaking medical advancement to put your name on, I'll punch you in the ear.
Well, my name's already on one of them, according to the chief. I mean, diabetes ... Affects 240 million people worldwide.
And Alzheimer's ... Is the seventh leading cause of death.
It's "Sophie's choice."
It's "Sophie's choice." Uh-huh
I've never seen that movie.
Oh, you should. It's really funny.
Greys, okay, how long has your father been having abdominal pain?
Abdominal pain?
It sounds like abdominal pain.
Thatcher Grey is not an easy man to get information from.
Our-our father's here in the hospital?
Yeah, I admitted him an hour ago.
You didn't know he was coming?
Well, what-what-what's wrong?
Could it be related to the liver transplant?
Of course. He's rejecting it because it's my liver.
Okay, look, just do me a favor, go take a blood sample, and try to get some more information out of him.
I-I need someone who speaks Grey.
Yeah.
Hey, stranger.
Meredith has two groundbreaking clinical trials, and I don't have any.
Okay, but you have a husband that loves you.
Yeah, so does she.
Then ... then I guess you're screwed.
Hello, NICU.
I thought I knew all the nurses on this floor.
How did I miss you?
I guess I'm just lucky that way.
I'm Alex Karev.
Neat.
And you are?
Not telling you my name.
Any reason why not?
Because, uh, I don't want to.
Okay.
Then how about you pass me one of those charts?
I hear there's a turnip in the cabbage patch.
A turnip?
Gorked. Brain-dead.
Dr. Robbins and I have a baby with a hypoplastic left heart.
The transplant coordinator ... Suggested the, uh, turnip as a potential donor.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, now you do get to know my name.
I'm Dr. Lucy Fields. I delivered that gorked baby.
So, uh, thanks for the heads-up.
I'll talk to the transplant coordinator.
But now you need to leave.
Come on. There's no reason to overreact.
Really?
Well, now you're barred from the NICU.
How's that for overreacting?
You can't do that.
Want to find out?
Oh, what do we have here?
You really don't want to know.
Let me get that for you, Dr. Torres.
Okay, Randy Sh-Shouse, 23.
Multiple injuries after slamming into a brick wall.
H-how did you ... Idiot and his idiot buddies built a human slingshot.
I wasn't supposed to hit the wall.
I was supposed to fly over the house and la-land in the pool.
But why would you do that?
So they could film it, put it on the internet, and show the world just how stupid they actually are.
Dude.
Ow!
Did you get that?
Yeah, buddy.
Yeah.
But why?
Because it's hilarious, that's why.
Okay, Randy, that must have been some kind of awesome slingshoto, because it looks like you've dislocated both hips.
Now I'm gonna need to get some X-rays.
I'm on it!
Wow. She's perky.
Mm-hmm. Better than stupid with a death wish.
You're sick enough that you need to come into the hospital, and you don't even call me?
The pain comes and goes. I didn't want ... To worry.
So you thought that you would just sneak in and just quietly reject Meredith's liver, not even make a fuss?
Just c-calm down, please.
Oh, no. I am calm. I am so calm.
I'm like the calmest one.
Okay, good.
Because there's something else that I should have told you.
I go to A. A. a couple times a week.
Yes, that I know.
No, I know you know, but sometimes, you have to get up in front of the group and you say your piece, and then people sometimes come up to you afterwards and say that they like what you said, and then maybe you go to coffee with them afterward.
Yeah, like a sponsor?
No, not a sponsor. Oh, how do I ... Oh, there you are. Sorry. I got turned around, and then I ended up back in the lobby.
Hey. N-no, no.
Mm. No, no, no, no.
Oh. Oh, god. What?
I'm sorry. Are-are you in pain?
Uh, yeah.
Not a sponsor.
I am so sorry.
This was not the way that I wanted to meet you.
Well, I didn't even know there was a you to meet.
I know. I-I'm sorry. I ... Okay, Mr. Grey ... Oh, hello.
Dr. Bailey, this is ... Danielle.
Dani. Hi.
Yes, Dani.
That's my father's girlfriend, whom I've just met just now.
Oh, I see.
Um, nice to meet you, Dani. I just have a few questions, and then I will let you get back to all of this.
Do you really think I could be rejecting this liver?
Because Dani has been amazing helping me take care of myself.
And I'm constantly taking pills.
His anti-rejection meds. Not, like, speed or anything.
'cause that would be inappropriate.
Um, when did the pain start?
12 days ago.
Sh-she's good with details.
Any fevers or changes in your urine or stool?
No fevers.
But there was a ... pain incident, uh, last week, Thursday.
A-actually, you might not want to hear this part.
I'm a doctor.
All right.
Well, we were being intimate ... Oh, j ... no.
And I was on top ... Oh, oh, okay.
Mnh-mnh.
Go on.
Dr. Avery.
Oh.
It's about time I had you on my service.
Thank you, Dr. Sloan.
I gotta say, I really think I have the hands for plastics.
Oh, forget about your hands. Look at those cheekbones.
Sir?
You're genetically blessed. Don't think I haven't noticed.
And speaking from personal experience, I can say that that will only help you in plastics.
That face? Better than a hundred billboards, my man.
All right, Dr. Sloan, I really don't feel comfortable being judged or praised based on my looks.
Oh, poor Mr. Green eyes.
Let's not pretend being beautiful's a burden.
Now come on. Mrs. Johnson's nose isn't gonna fix itself.
How about a little sparkle?
There it is.
Hip dislocation, fractures of his femur, radius, ribs, and metacarpals.
Okay.
Should we just, uh, go ahead and reduce those hips?
Kepner, I need you to speak differently.
I'm sorry?
It's your voice. It's a little ... Just speak differently.
Like with an accent or ... Never mind.
You know, how about you get me a muffin from the cafeteria?
Get me the sugariest kind you can find, and some coffee.
Wait. No.
Damn it. No coffee.
Okay.
No. You know what? Yes.
Coffee. Please.
Great.
Crap! No. N-n-no coffee.
You sure?
No, no coffee. Just ... Just-just go.
Okay.
Uh, did you still want the muffin?
Yes.
Okay, yes, I know that I'm not Dr. Bailey, but he's my father, and I really need his lab results.
Sorry, I can't do it.
Okay, well, then maybe I'll just let your supervisor know that
I've been highly unsatisfied with your service today.
This isn't the mall. We don't have comment cards.
Well, maybe you should.
Hey. You okay? You need me to talk to him?
Mark, no.
My day has been too messed up to have you in it, too.
Son of a bitch.
We know without a doubt that this heart is a viable option.
How? How do we know that this is a good match?
Well, babies under a year haven't developed an immune system that will reject the new organ.
It makes matching a lot easier.
But we're still four weeks away from the due date.
Our O. B. isn't even in town right now.
I'm covering for Dr. Napolitano.
I've got her blessing to go ahead and do the C-section today.
Today? T-that's really ... Colin, time's an issue here.
We need to inform the transplant board as soon as possible if you want this heart.
Otherwise, it's gonna go to another family.
Whoa. Okay. You know what?
There are a lot of doctors in the room right now.
So why don't we give the Cookes some space?
You can have one of the nurses page us when you've made a decision.
What's going on? Why didn't you page me?
Turnip, Karev?
You tattled on me?
You're so off this case.
Seriously? I have said way worse stuff than that.
Yeah, not helping.
Are you kidding me? !
Avery, you want to give the osteotomies a shot?
Yes, sir.
Mallet, please.
You live with Lexie Grey now, right?
How's she doing these days?
Okay, I guess.
Okay? She hasn't seemed upset?
She kind of cries sometimes, but she seems okay.
Now are you gonna strip the, uh, lateral cartilage here?
Crying seems fine?
She's a girl. Girls cry.
But you don't know what she's been upset about?
Not really any of my business.
Yeah.
What's next?
Next, I finish up here while you go find out what's up with Lexie.
Sorry?
She's upset. You're gonna find out why.
You want to be on my service, then serve.
Use that Avery sparkle.
Dr. Sloan ... I'm gonna do a couple more rhinoplasties this afternoon.
You do me this solid, and I just might be persuaded to let you take the lead on one.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Oh. What are you doing?
Uh ... I looked it up, and those, uh, caffeine studies showed birth defects in rats, and I'm not a rat, so ... Tell her I'm not a rat.
Well, let her have ... Hey, we took a vote.
Yeah, well, I have to fix multiple fractures, Arizona.
That's major surgery. Okay? So that totally changes the situation, completely.
And Mark's not here, so it's your vote against mine.
I need caffeine.
Okay, you want caffeine that badly, Calliope, fine.
You're a grown-up. You can make your own decisions.
That's right. So ... Damn it.
Oh!
Damn it!
That is s not fair. You're not fair. Ugh.
For someone who has a history of ambivalence towards motherhood, you got the whole guilt thing down cold.
I am entitled to an opinion.
I mean, I've been left out of too much of the conversation already, and I sure as hell did not choose Mark Sloan to be the father.
So if I'm gonna do this, then you know what?
I'm gonna have a voice.
Oh, god. That's good.
Holy crap. Your mom was smart.
Truck.
Cabin. Spoon.
3-for-3.
Crap. This is so good.
Is it better than this?
'Cause seriously, Mer, you'd have to have died of Alzheimer's to fail this.
I don't even know if I'm doing it yet.
You have to. Mother-daughter surgeons cure leading killer?
I mean, I'm still jealous, and I'm doing a heart transplant on a baby that hasn't even been born yet.
Will you shut up about that?
You're the one who needs to keep his mouth shut, cabbage patch.
Screw this. I've been on this case for a month.
I'm not just gonna sit here.
Meredith, you have to come see dad.
Oh, does he want more organs?
He wouldn't say.
He was too busy loving up on a tattooed 20 year old.
Is that upsetting you?
You wanna talk about it?
No.
No worries.
I have a surgery to get to.
Meredith.
I can't deal with my dad. I'm too busy with my mom.
Mer, let's go.
I want to see your dad making out with his tatted-up fiancée.
They're not engaged.
Are you sure?
Meredith, please.
Fine.
You're doing great, Sarah.
I didn't hear her cry.
Her lungs were junky. We had to intubate.
She deteriorated fast.
I'll call for an X-ray and an ultrasound.
Already ordered it.
Well, what's her PH? You'll need an A. B. G ... .
Karev, we got it.
Yeah, Dr. Robbins, she's my patient.
Not anymore.
You got something for me, Avery?
I do, actually. Uh, her dad's here.
He might be rejecting his liver, and he brought his 20-year-old girlfriend.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Lexie's probably going crazy.
Meredith's no help when it comes to their father.
I'm not gonna be lead surgeon on a rhinoplasty, am I?
She just needs someone to talk to.
We are not close. That is not something we do.
Peanut butter cups.
What?
She's a stress eater. You get her eating, you get her talking.
She loves peanut butter cups.
That's ridiculous.
Tomorrow, I'm doing a series of cleft palate surgeries for the nightingales foundation pro bono.
That sort of thing might look fantastic on the résumé
of someone who's in the running for chief resident.
Might?
Get some results ... we'll talk.
Ugh. Get in there.
And do what?
Well, make it stop.
There's no way she's 20. She's gotta be like 26, 27.
I'm 27.
Oh.
Gross.
Ugh.
Uh, tiny baby heart time.
Careful when you go in there, Mer.
You tangle with one hells angel, you tangle with the whole gang.
Okay.
You coming?
I'm not going in there again.
Seriously, Lexie?
I can't.
Well, then I'm going back to work.
Meredith ... Ow! Ooh! Uh!
Gah!
Oh, oh.
All right. Hey, uh, move, please.
I'm gonna page Bailey.
This is what happened last time.
All right, dad, is it the same pain?
Where-where does it hurt?
I'm telling you, I have seen this before.
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
Will you please let him talk?
He can't talk.
No, it's here. Ow!
All right, all right. Just back up, please.
Baby, it's gonna be okay. Okay? I'm right here. I'm sorry.
Back up.
I need to do something.
Please just tell me what I can do.
Okay, back the hell up right now!
Oh, god. Oh.
All right. All right, dad.
The blood tests indicate that your liver is fine.
Is there anything at all that you've left out?
It's when he pees.
Uh, just now and then last Thursday, we had mexican food, and he drank all this water because it was spicy, and he went to the bathroom as soon as we got home.
I was freaked out when he screamed later during the s*x, I didn't even connect it.
Uh, all right, all right. Good. That helps.
So what-what do you think it could be?
Well, that ... It could be kidney stones or your prostate.
Prostate? Are you saying he could have cancer? He ... He can't have cancer.
That's what happens when your boyfriend's an old man.
Old men get cancer.
Lexie, come on.
No, but see, if you were a doctor like we are, you'd realize that when we use the word "prostate,"
it doesn't necessarily mean cancer.
Dr. Grey ... No, see, freaking out and jumping to conclusions like a little child isn't gonna do him any good.
I am scared, okay?
I am terrified over here, and I've got questions.
You're terrified? We're his family.
I am his family, too!
No, you're not his family!
You're his midlife crisis!
Lexie, Lexie. That's enough. You're out of line.
No, y ... fine.
Lexie.
Le ... Uh, cancer is-is one of a hundred things it could be.
Dr. Bailey will run some more tests just to rule it out.
It's far more likely there's another explanation for this.
Are you the daughter that gave him the liver?
I am.
Thank you.
Say it again for the camera.
No. No, I don't think I will.
Kepner, talk to the camera so we can get to the O.R.
In my normal voice?
Or y ... Randy has multiple fractures.
The most pressing problems are his hip dislocations.
So we are going to reduce them as soon as possible before they loose blood flow.
Reduce?
Uh, pop 'em back into place.
Oh, man.
Hold on. Let me, uh, let me get up on this chair for the wide angle.
Uh, yeah.
We're not gonna ... we're not gonna do it here.
He has to be sedated, and we have to fix his femur, so we're just gonna do everything in the O.R.
Wait. What if we did the hips here, You know, while I'm awake?
And then I can give the thumbs-up to the camera.
Uh, you're really not grasping how much this will hurt.
Well, it's for the art, Dr. Torres.
You know what?
That is a great idea.
Dr. Hunt, I think that it's ... Dr. Torres, it is for the art.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay. O-okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah.
Marcus, hop on that chair. Kepner spot him.
Yeah, come on. Okay?
All right. Sure.
Okay. You guys ready?
Okay.
Aah! Please stop! Stop!
Stop! Turn the camera off! Stop! Oh!
Turn the camera off! Marcus, turn the camera off!
That totally cheered me up.
Well, art has that effect.
Mm.
Listen ... I'm sorry about the turnip thing.
I shouldn't have said it.
But doctor to doctor, you overreacted.
That's my patient. I deserve to be in there.
You deserve it?
Huh?
You know, I have a patient, too.
You want to know what happened to my patient?
Look, I'm sure it's ugh ... She had a 40-hour labor, and then the baby was stuck on an angle, wouldn't drop.
So my patient just had to push ... and push and push.
And you want to know what you say to a woman who's in that kind of pain?
You say,"One more, Jackie."
"One more, and you're gonna see that baby."
"One more, and you're gonna have a beautiful baby boy."
"I know it hurts. I know it does."
"But give me one more, Jackie,"
"and you get a baby."
That's how you get a woman to tear her own body apart.
You promise her a baby.
You make a promise, and she hurts herself because she trusts you.
And then ... when the baby comes out and he's not, uh ... he's not ... You're the one that's gotta tell her that you were ... mistaken.
Makes me kind of lose interest in what you deserve ... Mr. Where's the cabbage patch.
Oh, hey. Dad's got a kidney stone.
Dr. Bailey's taking him up to the O.R. now.
Oh, she didn't just give him a strainer? It's gotta be huge.
Yeah, well, he deserves it.
You know, I never really got it before, but this is how he operates.
Starts up a new family, stops talking to the old one. So he'll go off and marry Dani, the tattooed lady, have six little midlife crisis babies, and I'll never hear from him again.
It's exactly what he did to you.
It is not exactly what he did to me.
Of course it is.
Lexie, my mother had an affair, and then took his kid across the country.
Your mother died, and he was miserable, and he started drinking, and he destroyed his liver.
This isn't about you. He found someone who makes him happy.
Just give them your blessing. Let him be happy.
What are you talking about? Don't defend him.
You hate him. Hate him with me.
Lexie, I love you, but you have to grow up.
Got a strong heartbeat.
I think she likes her new heart.
Of course she does. It's delightful.
All right. Let's take off the clamp, Dr. Yang.
Why is her blood pressure so low?
There's a very low arterial pressure wave.
All right, let's, uh, let's check it.
Maybe there's a kink in the art line somewhere.
Damn it. Turn up the flow.
That aorta needs a long diagonal anastomosis.
Well, that'll take at least 45 minutes.
Well, we don't have that. We've gotta do it in 30, otherwise we're gonna lose her. Scalpel. Clamp it.
Start the clock.
Son of a bitch.
I hate this, I hate this.
Come on. Come on.
What time do you have, Yang?
27 minutes.
Okay. I'm ready.
Clamp off.
We got this.
Robbins, Altman, they got this.
Yeah? Then why do you look sick?
Pressure wave's coming back.
Oh. Systolic's 57.
60.
64.
82.
Oh, that's it. Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Chief, I'm, uh, I'm with a patient.
Did you get a chance to look over the materials?
I did. It's amazing.
Well, the next step is getting the funding in place, and I can make two phone calls and have that by midweek.
Uh, s-so you're waiting for ... Uh, you.
You have to sign on as co-investigator so we can start moving forward.
Chief, it's an amazing offer.
It's not an offer, Meredith.
I can't offer something that doesn't belong to me.
It was your mother's work, and it's only right that you continue it.
I, um ... So you think that I owe it to her?
Honestly?
I think she owes it to you.
She didn't give you a lot of love, but she gave you her talent and her name ... And this.
This gift could change the course of your career.
I ... have to get back inside.
Meredith ... It might change the way you think about her.
It could be the greatest thing the both of you ever did.
How did it get to this?
How did four seconds of internet fame become worth breaking yourself into a million pieces?
He did it because he thinks it's funny.
That's bull. You don't just put yourself at that kind of risk.
Well, it's his decision.
His decision?
Idiots like this shouldn't be allowed to make any ... It is his body, okay? And you don't get to say what he can and can't do with it. He is a person.
He gets to make his own damn choices.
I am going through the worst caffeine withdrawal of my life because someone thinks that being pregnant means I'm no longer of sound freakin' mind!
You're pregnant?
Shut up! I'm not endangering my baby.
I just ... I just want one damn cup of coffee!
Okay. Kepner, go get Dr. Torres a cup of coffee.
Okay?
Run.
Oh.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Congratulations.
Oh, whatever.
Just come around here and help me with his hip.
All right. One ... Mm-hmm.
Two, three.
She doesn't seem so bad.
Candy?
Screw you and your candy.
She's terrible.
All right.
Ever notice how my sister's a jerk?
I, um ... Yeah,"Give them your blessing."
What a bunch of crap.
You know,"Let him be happy"? What about me, you know?
Everybody's making these huge life decisions, and they're not even considering how it will affect me, how I'll feel, you know?
I'm supposed to be such a big part of their lives, and yet they're leaving me out of the conversation completely.
You know, starting up new families and springing it on me when it's already a done deal.
You know,"Hey, Lexie. Guess what."
"I found a tatted-up skank to be your new mommy."
"Hey, Lexie. I'm gonna have a baby."
"You're just gonna have to be okay with that."
Wait a second. Your dad's having a baby?
No, not my dad.
Mark.
Mark is having a baby.
And he didn't even ask my opinion.
He just clobbered me with it again.
And he's leaving me behind ... again.
So we're done, you know?
We have to be.
But I miss him.
Crap.
My dad's tatted-up skank isn't the bitch.
I am.
Probably a good start would be to stop calling her a tatted-up skank.
Right.
Thanks ... for listening.
Anytime.
Hey.
I banned him from the NICU this morning.
I kinda want to go in there and kick him out.
Yeah, punishing Karev is one of my favorite pastimes, too.
He's harsh sometimes, but he's also the guy that gets thrown off a case and then sits in the gallery and watches an entire surgery just to make sure his patient's okay.
I'll teach him to be less of an ass.
But I don't have to teach him how to care.
Do you even have the authority to ban someone from the NICU?
I don't know.
Hmm.
Oh, oh, oh
Just in time, Avery. Scrub in and take the lead.
That's okay.
I just came by to tell you that you were wrong.
Those, uh, peanut butter cups got me nowhere.
You're kidding.
Guess you overestimated that Avery sparkle, huh?
Where you goin'? Scrub in.
Really?
I-I-I assumed, no results, no surgery.
I'm not a total b*st*rd.
You gave it your best shot. Scrub in.
Okay.
I don't know.
It's okay. Take your time.
Truck.
Cabin.
Remember the third word, mom?
We should've come earlier.
She has a harder time in the evenings.
She's doing fine. We're just running some tests.
It's "Spoon," Mom.
Remember,"Spoon"?
I don't know why we're here.
Why are we here?
It's such a little word.
Can we go home now?
Okay, mom.
Okay.
He's gonna be sore for a while.
You'll need to make sure he drinks plenty of water.
Dr. Grey.
Is he okay?
He's fine.
Uh, Lexie.
Will you please just make sure that he calls me?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I'm almost five years sober.
We support each other, and ... I'm good for him.
And he is really, really good for me.
Is that a hooker on your shoulder?
I was drunk.
Okay.
There he is.
How you feeling, buddy?
Can't straighten it out any more than that.
Ah, there's his surgeon.
You're the man, Dr. Hunt. How'd he do?
Okay, Randy, since there was a tear in your joint capsule, we needed to open up the hip to reduce it.
We put a rod and screws into the other femur to fix that and reduced the other hip.
And this piece of hardware is keeping your wrist fracture together.
Whoa.
That's intense.
Is that, like, some sort of record or something?
Like the worst case you've ever seen?
Um, no. No, no. The worst case I ever saw was a guy who had an ex fix in his arm like this one, but he also had a gaping hole with exposed bone that needed to be covered.
He also had a matching hole that, uh, ripped through his back and tore his stomach apart.
Needed 11 surgeries to reconstruct his abdomen.
He survived all that?
No. No, he didn't.
But, you know, come to think of it, your situation, it is actually worse.
Mm-hmm. How?
Well, that guy ... he threw himself in front of a grenade to save six other soldiers.
He didn't launch himself into a brick wall so the internet could laugh at him.
Turn the camera off, Marcus.
Chief.
You know, I had forgotten this about your mother.
She wrote everything down.
She didn't have a thought or a fragment of a thought that didn't get scribbled in some journal.
She was compulsive.
Lucky for you that she did.
Lucky for both of us.
No, for you.
You knew the woman who wrote them.
That's why I gave them to you.
I was happy to read them and to understand her better, but the woman I knew was different.
But I am starting to realize how scared she must have been.
That had to be why she was writing everything down.
She must have been so scared.
Meredith, I ... So please, go ahead.
I think it's right that you continue her work.
But I really just want to cure her disease.
Good night, chief.
Good night.
So ... What's your plan?
Sleep.
My plan for tonight is sleep.
I was gonna hit Joe's before heading home.
You wanna come?
I just need to crash.
Yeah. No, I get that.
Maybe tomorrow.
For sure. Yeah.
Sorry about your patient.
Thanks. I'm happy for yours.
Hey, you want to get a ... No.
Right.
Oh.
We made dinner ... for you.
What is it?
Um, grilled chicken breast and some brown rice and broccoli ... Mmm.
And ... is that coffee?
Yes, it is.
And here's the thing ... I get that things are gonna be different now.
And, uh, that's why I'm gonna eat that chicken even though the only thing I want right now is a peanut butter sandwich.
Great. I'm really happy ... Oh, I'm not done.
If we're gonna do this whole
"Everybody gets a vote" thing, there's gonna be a new system.
We'll still each get one vote, but also, the baby gets a vote.
As I house the baby, I'll be speaking for him/her.
And since I'll be pushing this baby out of a very small hole in my body, I'll also get an extra-special v*g1n* vote.
So that's, uh, three votes for us, two votes for you guys.
Oh, we get the final say.
Now I'll be using my many votes to say that once a day, I will have one cup of regular coffee, which is perfectly fine according to the studies that I've read, at least until I begin breast-feeding.
Now anybody want to argue with my extra-special v*g1n* vote?
No.
No, thank you.
Great.
Oh, we also vote that Mark gives me a foot rub.
I'll go get the lotion.
Okay, well, I guess that a peanut butter sandwich is doable if you eat the broccoli.
Deal.
Surgery is a high-stakes game.
Did you decide?
I did.
I choose you.
I'm glad.
I've been going over the data you collected today.
And so far, it is 100% consistent with the pretrial phase.
Which means what?
It means that it's not not working.
Oh. That's great news.
You want to know what else is great news?
What?
Kids aren't coming home for over 20 minutes.
And no matter how high it stakes sooner or later you just gonna have to go with your gut.
And maybe, just maybe that will take you right where you were meant to be in the first place.How much can you actually accomplish in an hour?
Run an errand maybe?
Sit in traffic?
Get an oil change?
When you think about it, an hour isn't very long.
60 minutes.
3, 600 seconds.
That's it.
In medicine, though, an hour is often everything.
We call it the golden hour.
That magical window of time that can determine whether a patient lives ... or dies.
Thank you, doctor.
Are you gonna help me at all or are you just gonna sit there and eat potato chips?
I performed four back-to-back fem-pop bypasses today.
This is the first chair I've seen since 7:00 A. M. , and this is the first food I've had since yesterday.
I choose potato chips.
you might want to get that.
Seattle Grace Mercy west emergency.
You brought this on yourself, you know?
You volunteered to help run the E. R. ?
Got it.
We've got a suspected appy on a 10 year old.
Let's page Robbins. You know, I saw a need and I filled it, like any good chief resident candidate.
Sadomasocochisc chief resident candidate maybe.
What is up with you?
You're all perky and cheerful.
Ah, you know, it's the, uh, fertility drugs.
We have stepped it up. I'm pumped full of hormones.
You know what's perky?
Quoi?
My boobs. They're huge.
Am I supposed to like big boobs?
Oh, god, no. They'll make you fall over.
So, um ... Callie mentioned a thing. Or it might not be a thing.
At least I hope it doesn't become a thing.
Hey, I got a patient with a headache better after sumatriptan.
He's ready to be discharged.
Just need you to sign off.
Is he neurologically intact?
Mm-hmm.
You did a C.T. ?
I did. It was negative. The most interesting thing about this guy is that he came into the E. R.
for a glorified migraine with a girlfriend from hell.
Ooh, which one is she?
Just point with your eyes.
No, I mean, I know. It's just not a priority
Right now, obviously ... Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Here.
Thank you.
So, um, Callie had a thing.
Yeah.
What kind of a thing?
Grey, you paged?
Yeah, we have a suspected appy on a 10 year old two minutes out.
Okay.
An unexpected thing.
Grey, call up. Tell 'em to get an O.R. ready.
I already did. O.R. five is prepped and ready for you.
Callie asked me to be her baby's godmother.
Oh.
Well, you said no to that, right?
You gotta say no to that.
Um ... E. K. G. results.
Thank you.
The guys at work overreacted and insisted I come to the E. R.
Sweetie, I had a big lunch. It hardly qualifies as chest pain.
No, what I need are some antacids.
I'll be there. I promise. Just tell Max to put on his jersey.
Okay? I'll be outta here soon.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be your doctor today.
Oliver Richter. Sorry about the phone.
I'm supposed to be picking up my son for the huskies game right now.
I'm sure he'll understand.
You don't know my son.
There are very few things more important to him than basketball.
Big fan, huh?
I'm just gonna take a quick listen.
All right.
The biggest 9-year-old fan you've ever seen.
Okay. So it says here that you've been experiencing some chest pain.
When did that start?
Uh, an hour ago, maybe two?
But I'm already feeling much better.
And you wouldn't just be saying that to get discharged faster?
Look, I got my son tickets to this game for his birthday.
He's been marking off the days on his calendar for weeks.
I can't be the reason he misses it.
Okay. Well, your E. K. G. looks normal, and your heart sounds good, but if there's one thing we don't take lightly around here, it's chest pain, so ... Could we go back and just pretend I said heartburn?
Would that get me out any faster?
No, probably not.
but Tyler is going to do a portable chest X-ray.
And we're gonna do a chest pain workup, and we will try to make it as quick as possible.
Okay?
Thanks, Dr. Grey, so much. Thanks.
So ... this is gonna be a thing.
Why am I telling Callie no again?
Um, while you're here, I need a second opinion on this E. K. G.
Do you see anything?
No. Looks, uh, normal. What are you doing here?
Thought you had the night off.
Yeah, I do. I'm not here.
What's medical records' extension?
Looks like you're here to me, which is good, because we're swamped. Take your pick ... Impacted bowel, suspicious rash, or really smelly guy.
Forget it. I only came in
'cause medical records called and said I had to sign all my unsigned charts
Or they would suspend my privileges.
You're getting suspended?
Dibs on his solo splenectomy tomorrow.
I better be able to finish this crap before the game tonight.
Told a patient yesterday he didn't have cancer, and he was so happy, he gave me two floor seats.
You took a gift from a patient?
Did you tell him you cured his cancer?
Uh, colectomy time. I'm out.
Excuse me. Hi, I-I'm sorry.
Uh, we were told that somebody would be by to set our son's leg ... Nathan Englundar.
It was a while ago. Several hours, actually.
And I was ... No, I know. You've been here a while. I'm sorry.
The problem is, we just don't have enough O.R. s available for non-emergent cases.
An O.R. ? Why would you need an O.R. ?
Your pediatrician hasn't been by to speak to you yet?
Your son has a broken femur, which is a severe break.
It requires a full cast on the broken leg, connected to ... a cast on the other leg to keep everything still so the bones will heal properly.
2 full-leg casts on a 4 year old?
And because your son is so young, we can't set the bones properly without putting him under.
Under meaning anesthesia?
And that requires an O.R.
I'm sorry. I know you've been waiting a long time.
As soon as an O.R. opens up, I'll let you know.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay.
The losers in medical records aren't answering.
Are you sure you can't stay and help out with some of this stuff?
Floor seats.
I understand what you are suggesting.
I know it is done by many medical professionals in this hospital.
But I am not a medical professional who would ever consider ... Maybe you should consider it.
Eli Lloyd ... do not test me.
Maybe you should consider the potential benefits.
All the intensely exciting, toe-curling potential ... Benefits.
Dr. Bailey.
Okay, uh, this is gonna be for a prescription-strength migraine medicine.
Just don't take it with alcohol.
Okay.
We're missing our anniversary dinner because you have a headache. A headache.
Do you know how hard it is to get reservations at this place?
I'm sorry, Gia. I am. But t it really hurts.
Hmm.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be ... Oh, Mrs. Webber.
Hi, dear. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
Does the chief know you're here?
Oh, please don't bother him.
I had a little fall is all.
Got home from work, slipped off the stepladder ... ohh ... landed on my wrist.
Oh, it's basically nothing. Ohh.
Well, it's not nothing.
Well, I-I brought lots of magazines and a good novel.
I am perfectly fine waiting until you make time for me.
I know you have far more pressing patients.
Well, you're the chief's wife, so that makes you my most pressing patient.
Oh.
Look, stew-man. They opened the doors right for us.
Are you sure about that?
This is gonna be fast. We'll be in and out, man.
But I can't believe you wouldn't let me drive, dude.
Dude, you're drunker than I am.
I can't believe you tried to stiff the cabbie.
Wow, it is bright in here.
Hey, could somebody do something about this?
You're a little early. I thought our date was at 6:30.
Well, I'm here now because a guy just walked into the pit with a knife sticking out of his head.
Sweet.
I mean, poor guy.
Is he stable?
He's neurologically intact, but ... All right. Well, I need to check on him sooner than later, so, Avery, take him down to C.T.
stay with him until I get there.
All right. Will do.
Okay, so you'll be down to see knife guy when you're done?
I will.
And then we'll have our date?
Wouldn't miss it.
6:30. Don't forget.
How did this guy get a knife in his head?
Oh, apparently there was a brawl at a tailgate party.
So you know how stupid guys get ... Dr. Bailey.
uh, I'm taking a nap.
Uh, I'm sorry.
What I-I mean to say is, I'm going to use this room to take a nap, because that's what people do in these rooms when they're tired, 'cause I-I have a child and a full-time job, and work long hours, so I'm just tired, Just very ... very tired.
Okay.
Okay.
I-I was just gonna ask you, had you seen Dr. Altman?
D ... no, I have not seen Dr. Altman
Nor any other doctors or nurses, because I will be in this room asleep, by myself.
Actually, I see her now. Dr. Altman.
I'm-I'm-I ... Dr. Altman, do you have time for a quick consult?
I was supposed to be off by 6:00, but ... Oh, okay, sure. Okay. Just walk with me.
Okay, so ... Oh, damn it.
He's early. Um ... All right, just, uh, Grey, give me a second.
Hi, uh, William.
Hey. It's, uh, it's nice to see you.
Wow. You look amazing.
Oh.
So official.
I mean, I-I knew you were a doctor, but you ... are a doctor.
Thanks. Sorry, I didn't ... I didn't have time to change.
I'm just ... No, no, no. The scrubs are strangely sexy.
Thanks. Um, you know, I have a few things to wrap up.
Do you mind hanging out for a few minutes?
Like, uh, ten tops?
Yeah, no problem. Take your time.
I'll just, uh, grab a seat here.
Hey, stranger.
Henry.
I didn't, uh, I didn't ... I didn't know that you were, uh, you were here today.
Yeah, they wanted to run a blood glucose test on me, so they gave me this nasty orange kool-aid to drink.
In about an hour, I gotta go give 'em some blood or pee.
And we don't really need to talk about my bodily fluids.
Sorry to be rude. Hi.
Hey.
Oh, sorry. Um, yeah.
Um, William, uh, Henry. Henry, William.
Are you, uh, are you a patient of Teddy's?
Something like that.
Anyway, I, um, I-I gotta go.
Uh, but I'll be back soon.
Promise.
All right, Grey, what do you got?
Okay, 42-year-old male, um, complaining of midsternal chest pain.
No cardiac risk factors, no angina.
Pain doesn't radiate. The E. K. G. looks clean.
These are his films, and they're mostly clear.
But I don't know.
Does the mediastinum look a little wide to you?
Because I know, sometimes that can happen with the portable X-ray.
You got cardiac enzymes?
Yes.
Hey, Kepner.
Yeah. How good are you at forging signatures?
Even if I were good at forging signatures, I wouldn't do it.
It's unethical and probably illegal. So I'm sorry.
You're just gonna have to finish signing your charts on your own.
I'll check on Mr. Richter right now. Call radiology.
Get him in for P. A. and lateral films, and tell 'em to rush it, cause I'd really like to get outta here and go on my date.
I mean, did you see that guy?
No forging signatures, Karev.
Radiology, please.
Forgery, huh? Why am I not surprised?
Whatever. I just want to get outta here so I can get to this game tonight.
Wait. You have tickets?
Tonight? It's the pac-10 title game.
Yeah, I know.
Win this, and the huskies get an automatic bid to March madness.
Yeah. Why do you think I'm powering through all these stupid charts?
Hey, what are you d ... what are you doing?
Of my ten patients in labor right now, none of 'em are past 3 centimeters, which means, I have some time to kill, and you can't miss this game. Hand me a pen.
I thought you thought I was a loser.
Well, you're a little less losery, now I know you like college hoops.
Hey, where's the knife guy?
Is it true he's walking and talking?
What about your colectomy?
Oh, postponed.
The wife snuck him a cheeseburger and fries before surgery.
So this thing with Callie ... I mean, you know it's a bad idea, right?
You don't want to be Callie's baby's godmother.
I don't?
No.
I mean, think of how many people have to die before you even get to step up ... Mark, Callie, and Arizona.
That's a lot of people.
It is, yes. A lot of dead people.
Right.
Whereas if you're my baby's godmother-in-waiting, it's only me and Derek.
One wrong turn down a dark, twisty road, boom, you're in.
Okay, let's be clear.
If I am ever a godparent to anyone's kid, it will be in name only.
I will not be taking care of children.
That's what boarding schools are for.
Which way to butcher block?
Trauma 2.
Okay. I understand you might be thirsty, but I'm sorry.
You cannot drink beer in here.
You're wasting it!
Oh.
Oliver, did you see Dr. Altman?
Yeah, she's sending me off for another X-ray.
Look, I know you guys have to cover all your bases, but ... No, I know. I'm sorry. But I put a rush on the X-ray, so hopefully it'll be quick, okay?
Yeah.
Grey!
Excuse me.
I was finishing a surgery just now when a scrub nurse asked me how my wife was feeling, because she'd heard Adele was in the E. R. , and I hadn't.
Now would you like to explain to me why I found out my wife was a patient in this hospital from my scrub nurse and not from you?
Richard, hush.
Let Meredith do her job.
She hasn't even had a chance to examine me yet.
Is that true?
Don't mind him, dear. He's just worried about me.
He gets gruff when he's worried.
I hurt my wrist.
I was trying to get out the holiday decorations and I ... ohh ... I slipped off the stepladder.
Oh, it was stupid. I should've waited for Richard to get home.
He's so much taller than me.
I requested an X-ray and an ortho consult.
I will call and make sure that they're coming down.
Don't touch that!
Ooh.
I think I better go see what that is.
You better.
Is everything all right?
Yes.
No!
I was just showing these guys how, when I scrunch up my eyebrows, the knife move see?
Oh, my god! my god! Stop! Whoa.
Don't do that!
Stop moving the knife!
Okay, okay.
You guys shoulda seen the brawl.
Stew-ball kicked that other guy's ass!
Yeah!
Okay, and now Stew-ball has a knife in his head.
Oh. Okay, let's focus. Stewart, how much is 14 plus 4?
18.
27 minus 13.
15?
No. 172 minus 60.
Oh.
I have no idea, but it's not because of the knife.
It's just 'cause I'm so drunk.
No, actually, it's just 'cause he's dumb.
Thanks, David. Really?
Unbelievable. His mental status is completely intact, if you don't count for his math skills.
It's like the knife did no damage at all.
So why don't you just pull the thing out?
'cause we got a games to gets to!
I'll drinks to that! Whoo!
No! No beer!
Buzzkill.
Uh-oh!
No!
Hey!
How many do you have?
Okay. Oliver's in X-ray, Stewart is stable and waiting for Derek, who should be here soon, Adele is waiting on ortho, and, uh, can I get the discharges from the last hour, please?
Sure.
Oh, and, uh, the boy in bed seven with the broken leg, Nathan Englundar ... let's check on the status of the O.R. for him, please.
Is this Lexie's patient with the headache?
Yeah.
Mitch Turner?
Mm-hmm.
How long ago was he discharged?
Not long. A few minutes ago.
Did he leave? Did he already leave?
Mr. Turner!
Mr. Turner, I need you to try to smile for me, please.
Who the hell are you?
I need you to try to smile for me, please.
Okay, can you lift your arms above your head like this?
Dr. Grey, is everything all right?
No, it's not.
We got a code C. V. A. Let's get stretcher out here, stat.
Can you repeat after me? The dog chased after the cat.
The-t dog ch-chased af ... What's going on? What's happening to him?
The-the dog ... Okay, I need you to help me.
What's happening to him? !
We need to get him on the ground.
The dog ch ... Okay, get your purse under his head.
Quickly, please.
The dog ch ... Okay. And help me secure his arm. Hold it like this.
O-o-okay, but wh-why are we doing this?
Because he's having a stroke.
Unsteady gait, slurred speech, asymmetric smile.
His symptoms started no more than 20 minutes ago, so we should be well within the golden hour.
Okay.
I know ... a stroke, right in front of me.
I mean, what if he had been driving me in the car when it happened?
Oh, wait. Hang on. Here's the doctor.
Hi. So the stroke team has taken him up to C.T.
We're gonna see if he's eligible for the clot-busting medicine.
We caught the stroke early, which is very good.
So-so on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being I might have to cancel our Aspen trip in a week, how is he?
You should cancel the trip.
You will not believe this.
Looks like the blade landed in the maxillary sinus.
Chances are, the knife itself is tamponading any major bleeding.
Probably best just to go ahead and open up the cranium.
Or we could just take him to the O.R.
And pull this thing out.
Really, Avery? Just pull it out?
Let me guess. You want to get out of here early to go to the game, just like everyone else.
Or since it looks like the blade didn't hit any major arteries or veins, he knows that a controlled extraction would be both safer and less invasive than a complete craniotomy.
Is that true, Avery?
Is that why you suggested we pull it out of his head?
Yeah. And I want to get outta here early to get to the game.
Me, too. I'm good with that. Let's just do what he said.
Yeah!
Lexie, I need to speak with you.
Thank you for getting me out of that room.
I swear, it takes everything just to be civil to Mark lately.
Such an ass. What's up?
Take a look at this. Look closely.
What do you see? Uh ... This is the patient's admitting signature when he came in.
And this is his signature when he was discharged.
Oh, no.
Mitch Turner, the patient you just discharged, is up in radiology being treated for a stroke.
Oh, god.
I know you know the signs of a stroke.
How did you miss this? Are you distracted by the Mark thing?
Is that it?
No, I checked the C.T.
He was having a classic migraine.
He's had them before. There's no way that he was having a stroke when I treated him.
Lexie, I know you know, this kind of headache can be a precursor to a stroke.
When you said you needed an ortho consult, you coulda mentioned it was the chief's wife, Grey.
I would've been down here a hell of a lot sooner.
No ... I am so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Webber.
You hurt your wrist in a fall?
Oh, it was so silly.
I'd just gotten home, and I was trying to get some ... ohh!
Reach something on the top shelf myself.
I-I just landed wrong.
Her wrist absorbed all the impact.
Yeah, it looks painful. We'll get you some more pain meds to help you out with that. Uh, your X-ray shows a hairline fracture.
Oh.
So it could have been a lot worse.
We'll splint you up and get you out of here in no time, okay?
You have me paged if you need anything, okay?
Okay. Mm.
Thank you for covering for me before with the chief.
You didn't have to do that.
Excuse me?
When you said I hadn't been by to examine you yet.
So you said that you fell when you got home ... from work.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
Do you remember hitting your head when you fell?
Not that I recall.
Dr. Grey, I have the new X-rays for Oliver Richter.
Okay. Let's get Mrs. Webber a head C.T.
Okay.
Oh, damn it.
Excuse me.
Hey. Hey.
Sorry to make you wait.
No, no problem. Um, really.
Henry here has been keeping me company.
Although he's probably sick of me by now.
I've been grilling him about the major leagues.
You didn't mention he used to play pro ball.
Oh ... I didn't know that he did.
It's not a big deal, really. Although there is a baseball card out there with my face on it somewhere.
Look, I don't mean to hold you guys up.
You probably have a-a reservation waiting.
Excuse me, Dr. Altman. Mr. Richter ... mediastinum looks borderline on the P. A. films. Take a look.
Okay, um ... that reservation
May have to wait just a-a little bit longer.
I'm sorry. I mean, if you want to reschedule, I totally ... No. Nonsense. I'm-I'm happy to wait.
You are saving lives.
Least I can do is take you out to dinner when you're done.
Thank you.
Did you-you ever pitch against Jeff Bagwell?
Once, and it wasn't pretty.
You were right. Get a C.T. to be safe, and I'll stick around to look at the results.
At least somebody's having a good night.
Good news?
Or not such good news?
Oliver, your second X-ray is still concerning.
Dr. Altman and I agree that you should have a C.T. , just to rule out anything serious.
And how-how long will that take?
Oh, that's my son calling.
He's worried we'll miss tip-off. What should I tell him?
Do I need to tell him we're gonna miss this game?
I wish I had an answer for you, but I think it's a safe bet you'll be late.
Max. Hey, buddy.
How's my little man doing?
Oh, daddy will be fine.
Don't you worry. Don't worry.
You just worry about all that popcorn we're gonna be eating.
Make sure he's on broad spectrum antibiotics.
You booked an O.R. ?
Wow. It didn't hit any brain matter at all?
Doesn't look like it from this.
How long till Shepherd gets down here to take a look?
He should be out of surgery any minute.
Good. Longer that thing stays in there, the higher the risk of infection ... One, two ... Or abscess formation.
Oh!
So now can we get outta here?
How is he, Grey?
Pupils are equal and reactive. He's alert and awake.
Can I get some more gauze for this wound, please?
Yeah.
Reflexes seem normal.
Give me that.
I'm fine. It's just a little headache is all.
I've had hangovers worse than this.
All right. What's the status on the blade?
Well, about that ... Yeah, there is no blade anymore.
What, uh, what happened?
Sir, just lay back and let me examine you, okay?
Could we just get a doctor, please?
I want to take a look at the C.T. s.
It's okay, bud. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay, Nathan.
Mommy, help me.
He's really hurting.
Okay, I'm gonna write an order for more pain meds.
It's okay, monkey. I know you want to go home.
It'll just be a little while longer, okay?
It will just be a little longer, right?
Tyler, where is the O.R. for Nathan?
I haven't heard back yet.
Okay, well, let's call them again, and let's call the ortho team and make sure they're ready to go, okay?
We will get to Nathan as soon as possible. I promise.
How's he doing?
Well, the blade went through his skull, didn't hit any major nerves or arteries, so he's gonna be fine.
Flesh wound?
Yeah.
I mean, that's the luckiest guy alive.
You're also pretty lucky, too.
It's past 6:30, and we haven't had our date yet.
I'm swamped. I can't leave.
I have one patient in C.T. , another one waiting for an O.R.
Well, your patient's C.T. isn't ready yet.
No. And the O.R. you're waiting for isn't either.
So okay. I mean, maybe I do right at this precise moment have one minute, but it's a minute.
That's perfect.
That's all I need is a minute. I need a minute.
Hey.
What ... Aah!
Oh, sorry
What? !
No one. It was nothing. That room is occupied.
Uh, just never ask me what I might have seen or might not have seen in there.
Okay, well, If we can't go in there, where are we gonna go?
I have an idea.
Where are we going?
Nowhere. We're gonna do it here.
Wait. No we're not.
Come on.
No! No way! Are you kidding me?
No. Drop your pants.
Come on. I'll be quick. I'll be in and out.
Oh, my god.
Eyes up here! Seriously. Are you kidding me?
No, I'm serious about this.
Where is your sense of adventure?
My sense of adventure is down on the first floor.
It's not in this elevator.
Come on. If not for me, then do it for your future baby.
Come on. Turn around.
I cannot believe I am doing this.
This future imaginary baby of ours better be worth it.
Okay. Here we go.
Ooh. Oh, there it is.
Ouch.
Ooh. There. I told you I'd be quick.
Mm.
I can't wait to meet our future fictitious baby.
Me either.
We got through those charts fast.
Floor seats, here I come.
So I just helped you get through three dozen charts in a fraction of the time it would have taken you to do on your own, basically ensuring you get to your floor seats on time.
How long do I have to wait till you ask me to go to the game with you?
Oh. I ... I-I mean, I was supposed to take Avery, But screw him.
Sure. You-you want to go?
No. I'm on call tonight, actually.
I just wanted to see if I could get you to ask me out.
Excuse me.
Just admit it. You like her.
Shut up.
God, I don't think you do understand, actually.
This has been going on since yesterday.
We took our son to an after-hours clinic where he was misdiagnosed, and then he was sent home without so much as a painkiller, and he was up all night crying.
And then this morning, our pediatrician sent us here.
And now we've been waiting around all day ... with our 4 year old son.
Believe me. I understand that a kid with a broken leg doesn't take precedence over a guy with a knife in his head, but my son is scared and he is in pain, so could somebody please just get to his leg already?
Please.
Yes, sir.
You still haven't helped that kid yet?
He's 4 with a femur fracture. You know how much that hurts?
No, I know. It's just been one of those days.
Tyler, isn't that O.R. ready yet?
They're prepping it now.
Grey, my wife was cleared by Dr. Torres.
You ordered a head C.T. for a broken wrist?
Yeah, I can explain that Sir. I have some concerns ... Dr. Grey, they're calling from C.T.
Your patient's coding in the scanner.
What?
They say he's coding.
Hold C. P. R.
V-fib. Page Altman.
Give me the paddles now. Charge to 200.
Clear.
Charge to 300.
Clear.
Got a pulse.
Yes!
Scans are up.
Grey, talk to me.
Uh, he was coding when I got here.
I defibrillated him three times.
I gave him three rounds of epi, two of atropine.
I loaded him up with amiodarone, but he's tachycardic now.
I mean, he's barely hanging on.
He needs surgery. Book an O.R.
Okay. I'll get a room prepped and ready.
No time.
His aorta's dissecting as we speak.
He needs surgery right now.
They're saying all the O.R. s are booked.
Well, tell 'em to bump someone, 'cause we're come up either way.
I have an O.R.
Tell 'em to bump mine and prep it for an emergency cardio.
All right. Here we go.
Got it. Go.
All right. Let clear it.
Let's hold that elevator!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Once these doors open, we're gonna have to get him in the O.R.
And open him as soon as possible.
I know.
Even then, if that aorta tears, we may already be too late.
And we're not gonna have time to scrub.
I know. I know.
Thanks.
Just pour the betadine straight on to the chest.
It doesn't need to be pretty. We need to get in there.
All right. Plug me in.
Scalpel.
Here you go.
Cautery.
Here.
Cauterizing now.
Get in there quickly, Grey.
Time is myocardium.
All right. Saw.
Get that retractor ready.
This guy thought he had a bad case of heartburn.
He went from that to this in less than 45 minutes.
That's how these work. How's his pressure?
70s and dropping.
Retractor.
Every beat of his heart rips this tear a little bit wider.
All right.
How many of these ruptured dissections
Have you caught in time to operate?
40. Maybe 50.
How many have you been able to save?
Three.
All right. I'm in.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Damn it.
He's bleeding out.
His aorta is wide open. All right, clamp.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Here.
All right, Grey. Let's try sucker bypass.
Cannulas.
It's not working. There's too much blood.
All right. Well, once we get him on bypass, it'll be easier to control.
Heart's fibrillating.
All right. Cardiac massage.
Paddles.
I've almost got him cannulated.
Charge to 10. Clear.
Damn it. He's bleeding out of his nose and ears.
I've been loading him up with blood, F. F. P. and factor VII, but I can't keep up with the losses.
Foley's full of blood, too.
He's D. I. C. his cannula sites are oozing.
Let's push 3 of epi. Set me up for another shock.
Clear.
Damn it.
Well, what can we do? Just tell me what to do?
There's nothing. His aorta is in shreds.
Well, what about ... There is nothing left to do. Call it.
Call it, Grey.
No, I mean, we ... Grey, we got here too late.
These are almost impossible to catch.
There is nothing that we can do. I'm sorry.
We need to call it.
Time of death ... 18:52.
Hey. I heard you lost a patient.
You know, it's not that I don't want to share you.
I mean, I don't want to share you, but that's not the reason I don't want you to be
Callie's baby's godmother.
Oh. Okay.
It just seems like, if you agree to be
Callie's baby's godmother, you're saying that I'll never have a baby of my own.
Meredith, you know, I ... I'm in no way saying anything that-that ... I know. It just feels that way.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I, uh ... Have to go have really uncomfortable conversation with Callie now.
How about you? What are you up to?
Oh, I have to contact Oliver's family.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, wait. You got, uh ... blood or something.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, chief.
About earlier ... It's all taken care of.
I checked Adele's head C.T. myself.
It was clean. Her wrist is in a splint.
And I'm taking her home now.
Well, I still have some concerns.
And if her C.T. was clean, then I have even more concerns.
Thank you, Meredith, but I assure you, Adele is fine.
Chief, she's been getting things very confused.
Meredith, she is fine, and I'm taking her home right now.
Why was she getting Christmas decorations down in February?
Good night, Meredith.
And she said she had just gotten home from work.
Didn't she retire?
Meredith ... Chief, something isn't right.
Okay, that's enough.
Now I know what you're implying.
And while I appreciate your concern, that's enough.
Adele had a scare today. She had a fall.
Any number of things could account for her mixing up a couple of details, not the least of which is her being interrogated by you.
Now if something bigger were wrong with my wife, I would know it.
You've got Alzheimer's on the brain.
I mean, you-you buy a car and you start seeing it everywhere you look.
Now you've been working on this Alzheimer's trial 24/7.
I get it.
But Adele is not your mother, Meredith.
She's my wife.
Now good night.
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I got pulled into an emergency surgery.
Where is Nathan?
Actually, a-a doctor came by to get him a little bit ago.
He's getting his casts put on right now.
Great. That's great news.
Dr. Grey, we have a surgical abdomen in bed three.
Okay, let's just get Oliver Richter's chart.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi, Max.
This is ... No, it's your daddy's doctor.
Is your mom around?
An hour ... one hour ... can change everything ... forever.
Well, we'll have to keep you overnight for observation, but your prognosis is very good.
Great.
So maybe we don't have to cancel our Aspen trip after all.
I just had a stroke.
I know.
And you're worried about our travel plans?
Well ... it's a nonrefundable trip.
Cancel the trip.
You know what? In fact, cancel all our trips.
How have I put up with you for two years?
I'm done with this.
We're done.
Get outta here.
Oh ... Now, before you give me another stroke.
W-wait, wait.
Can I see your keys?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now you can go.
An hour can save your life.
So before he gets off the phone and since I now have to go pee in a cup, uh, I just have to say this ... I basically spent the past hour on a first date with William myself.
And I don't know how much you know about the guy, but this is what I know ... um, he wears driving gloves.
Yeah, and he doesn't live with his mother, but until recently he lived above her house, and he used the word "Shant,"
and he wasn't being funny, and he has yet to tell me a story about himself in which he is not the hero.
So as, uh, as your husband ... I think we can do better.
Good news. Not only was I
able to push the reservation, but I also got us a table by the window.
Black truffle gnocchi awaits. Ready?
Ready.
An hour can change your mind.
So when's your next break?
Okay. Unh-unh. No.
This ... will never happen again at work. Understood?
Sure.
Okay.
Until your next break.
Sometimes an hour is just a gift we give ourselves.
All right, Stewart, you're choosing to leave against medical advice, so you're free to go, but this is my number.
Now if you experience any of the neurological symptoms on this sheet, you call me, all right?
Somebody should stay with you tonight and have plenty of fluids ... Not beer. Not beer.
Will do, doc.
Thanks, doc.
All right.
For some, an hour can mean almost nothing.
I can't believe he walked in with a knife in his head and is walking out an hour later to go to a ball game.
Speaking of which ... any chance you want to go to the game, too?
Apparently Karev didn't want his floor seats.
So you interested?
Actually, yes.
Yes, I am.
For others ... an hour makes all the difference in the world.
Now, Nathan, when you wake up, you're gonna have two big casts on your legs.
But that's a good thing, because it means it's gonna make your leg better, okay?
But right now, I have a very important question for you, And that is, what is your favorite color?
Blue.
Blue it is, then.
Let's prep the blue casting material, please.
All right, I'm gonna take this mask, Nathan, and I'm gonna lower it ... But in the end ... it's still just an hour ... one of many ... many more to come.
60 minutes ... 3, 600 seconds ... That's it.
And it starts all over again.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be your doctor today.
It says here you've been experiencing some abdominal pain.
When did that start?
And who knows what the next hour might old?I thinking we put the tub here.
That way you can take a bath and look out the window at the trees.
But that means we have to move the sink here, because there's no way we can get two sinks on that wall.
Okay.
Okay, so do you want me to move the tub or you want to share a sink?
I have one opinion, and that is that I just want a tub deep enough that it covers my knees and boobs ... Knees and boobs at the same time.
Yeah, I gotta go. You're useless. Mwah. Love you.
The dude's building you a dream house.
I can't read these stupid things.
You just don't give a crap.
I'm taking baby drugs to make my uterus less hostile, and I don't know, it makes my eyes dry, and I have to squint to see, and I don't really care enough about the tub/sink relationship to, you know ... You should talk to that hot O. B.
You are always drumming up reasons to talk to that hot O. B.
Everyone figures doctors are the most responsible people they know.
They hold lives in their hands. They're not flakes.
They don't loose track of important details or make stunningly bad judgment calls.
'Cause that would be bad, right?
Oh, look.
Aww.
Nice size, good-looking placenta.
Is that an arm?
Yep.
Aww.
All good. Did you schedule an amnio yet?
Um ... we don't need an amnio.
Um ... we don't?
Of course we do. We'll set it up.
Why do we need an amnio?
I can think of a hundred reasons why.
You want me to take 'em down one by one or all together?
Hey, hey, hey.
It's so nice that there are three of you.
I gotta go. Don't let her shove a giant needle in your belly before we discuss this.
It's not giant. 9 inches.
Okay, so I'm really sorry about this, but with a clinical trial, the paperwork never ends.
Have there been any changes to your memory in the last week or so?
Oh, I don't ... I don't think it's worse.
Went to see Dr. Kesten, and, uh, couldn't figure out what floor he's on, but that's ... that's always the case.
Well, that place is a maze.
Did you have a problem or was that scheduled?
No, well, he's ... he's the one who first diagnosed me, and I was kind of angry when he said it was Alzheimer's.
I ... I called him a quack.
I, uh, figured I should apologize.
Well, I'm sure he gets that a lot.
Have there been any changes in your schedule in the last week or so?
I ... I don't work, and, um ... I get lost on the way to the post office, so I don't do so many errands.
So how about your sleeping and your eating?
Well, we have, uh, breakfast together before the boys leave.
Right.
And lunch ... Well, I ... I'm not home till pretty late, so I ... I don't know ... Half a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Well, I make one when we get home, and we share it.
Okay. And, uh, what about the drugs ... any side effects?
No.
Okay.
The pink ones make you thirsty.
Dry mouth. Y ... yeah.
Right, right, right.
And water helps with that?
Yeah.
Okay. Very good.
Ricky ... big day.
Bring it on.
Is this your sister?
This is my girlfriend ... Julia.
You're kidding. He's been talking about you for months.
I figured, if there was ever a day to take off work, it's when your boyfriend's getting new lungs.
Smart. She waited for the real fun.
All right. Let's do this.
Well, your new lungs should leave Portland in about two hours.
You haven't taken any of your cystic fibrosis meds since last night, right?
No food, no water, no drugs.
Great. So we'll just do one last workup, and then we'll get you to the O.R.
Oh, and, uh, Julia, write down your number, please, and give it to Dr. Grey. - Why?
Well, so we can call you when Ricky's in surgery if we have any news.
When was the last time you put in an application to the F. D. A. ?
It's been a while, sir.
Well, it would have to be, because if you had any recollection of what's involved, then you wouldn't interrupt me in the middle of compiling
357 pages of an application.
Do you know how easy it is to lose one page out of 357?
It's gotta be quite easy.
They look for reasons to kill a study.
Do you know what they consider a good reason? - A missing ... One missing page. Now you're a smart man, Hunt.
You have leadership potential, management potential.
I mean, I think you shy away from that.
That may well be, sir.
I mean, you can handle a V. I. P. patient.
I mean, if you don't mention the chief of surgery, they won't ask for the chief of surgery.
Did you mention me?
I think I did, sir.
Now why would you do that?
Did you not know about my application?
I think I knew, sir.
Then what on earth were you thinking?
Your wife, sir. That's what I was thinking.
Just when you thought you were done, we need more blood.
Well, if there's any left, it's all yours.
Well, Dr. Shepherd is going to come up and take a look at you, and if these labs are clean, then we're gonna move you up to the O.R. floor.
Good.
Hey. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that mom gets the good stuff, okay? - Okay.
Hey, Kyle. What's this on your neck?
Oh, that's just my bump. It doesn't hurt or anything.
We've been meaning to make an appointment, but ... with everything there's been going on ... I'm a full-time job.
No, you're not, okay. I should've called.
Well, we have doctors coming out of our ears here.
So I'll have someone come up and take a look.
It's just one less thing to worry about.
Thank you.
Okay.
I was in the cereal aisle, and I tripped on one of those big display ... fruit spreads or ... or some nonsense and the whole thing came down.
Lido and an epi, please. 5-0 prolene.
Okay. Excuse me.
Oh, it's a cut, Mark. You don't have to show off.
You can give me a couple of band-aids and be on your way.
Yeah, that's not how this is gonna go.
You ... you tripped on the display or you tripped over your feet and fell into the thing or ... The chronology escapes me, Richard.
I was more focused on the fact that there was jam and ... and shard glass all over my coat and my pants and the pants of the store manager, who would not leave me alone until he packed me away into an ambulance.
Oh! You know, this whole thing is just ridiculous!
This is twice, honey. I mean, your wrist ... It's those shoes. Now they are supposed to tone your derriere, but I cannot feel the ground when I walk on them.
I am going to throw them away. If somebody would just give me a couple of band-aids, I can be on my way.
You're not going anywhere.
No, if you make a big fuss about this ... Mrs. Webber.
Hmm?
I'm about to put a needle in your face.
I'd be extremely grateful if you'd stop moving.
Mm.
Did they come by with the forms?
I think I signed 200 of them.
That sounds about right. You just ... You just gave us your firstborn.
You need a drink of water, Julia?
Just asthma. Sorry. .
Nothing brings people together like respiratory disorders.
Mm. Romantic.
Dornase.
It's mine.
It has Julia's name on it.
Rick, why is she on dornase?
I'm gonna go.
Wait, Julia, do you ... you have cystic fibrosis? - Go.
No, wait a minute. Okay?
Nobody's going anywhere.
Do you know how dangerous cystic fibrosis patients are to each other? - We know.
Your disease isn't contagious to anybody in the general population. It's not like you can't date.
You just can't ... you can't date each other.
You can infect each other with bacteria there's no way you can fight.
We know!
You know how many times we've heard the warnings?
Never get closer than 3 feet from another C. F. patient.
It's a drag. Okay? There's no question. I get it.
No, you don't.
Ricky gets it. Nobody else gets it.
We both tried dating. People can't handle it.
People cringe as soon as you start coughing, like you're gonna kill them.
This is dangerous.
Depression is dangerous.
Living by yourself ... with nobody who understands you, that's dangerous.
We spent eight years making small talk on opposite sides of a doctor's waiting room.
And one day we decided that life with risk is better than not really living.
We deserve to be together.
Kepner, you're on peds today?
Yeah, some kid already puked on me.
Okay, so one of my patient's son has a lump on his neck.
So would you just do a workup on him, and if it's anything, kick it up to Robbins?
Fine. You owe me one.
No, I don't.
I'm doing you a favor. You owe me one.
You're doing your job.
I owe you gratitude and respect.
I already had your respect.
Uh, Hmm.
Give Yang all your patients today.
I have an S. M. A. embolectomy.
Well, I'll take your embolectomy.
Yang can take the rest. You take my wife.
Now I want my embolectomy even more than I did before.
She's fallen and ended up in my E. R. twice.
Maybe it's an inner ear thing, affecting her balance, maybe it's a pinched nerve. I don't know.
All I know, is you're gonna run every test that has a name.
I was looking forward to my embolectomy.
Everyone's unhappy.
Get in here.
You paged me?
Yeah, I need you to check my eyes.
I'm not an eye guy.
I don't know how this crap works.
All right, well, I already did the chart.
I'm, like, 20/25, but I ... I ... I ... now I need you to look at my eyes through this thing.
Maybe it's glaucoma.
Hey, you could get a prescription for pot.
All right. Uh, look up.
Look down.
Doesn't look like glaucoma.
Uh, your cornea looks fine.
Good.
Yeah, but you still can't read the chart.
Yeah, but if I squint ... Normal people don't squint. All right.
Read the chart, line 8.
No squinting.
"D, C, P, I."
You're blind. .
Shut up.
Can you even see me?
Yeah, and you look like a real moron.
I need a real eye doctor.
Can you even see enough to operate?
When I do the squinting thing, I see fine.
Don't quit your day job.
Yeah, well, you keep squinting like that, and you're gonna get crow's feet, but I'm good at plastics.
You want me to do something about that?
I've lost too many babies in my time ... Addison terminated, Sloan disappeared.
I'm not letting it happen again.
I don't care what kind of baby it is.
Okay, you know what? You can't be glib about this.
A special needs baby can be a very sick baby.
We could be talking about a lifetime of surgeries and hospital stays and pain. It's not all hugging and the Special Olympics.
Amnios come with risks, too.
One in some not-insignificant number result in miscarriage.
1 in 300.
She's not 45.
The Down's rate isn't all that high in women her age.
Can ... can we have ... can have a minute? Can I just ... Just ... I ... There's no pulling anybody aside.
We have a relationship, Mark.
Part of that doesn't include you.
She's carrying my kid.
All right, if she gets a minute, then I get a minute, too.
Ok, you know what? No one gets a minute.
I have a patient. The patient gets a minute. - Oh.
I've got a friend who can't see, and, uh, she thinks that maybe her, uh, fertility meds ... Your friend?
You think I'm making it up?
You're looking for reasons to talk to me because the last time we spoke, you asked me out, and I said no.
So now you're taking my temperature to see if I was actually busy or just not interested.
You can't ask me out again, not after what you perceived to be a rejection, because even though your whole rap is about confidence, you're about as self-assured as a chihuahua.
Your friend, uh, she doesn't need my help.
If she did, she'd call me.
So I should just ask you out again?
It's a lot simpler, don't you think?
Are you free for dinner?
Nope. Busy.
Well, at first I thought it was a benign cyst, but it looks like it's probably a cystic hygroma.
Wow. The trachea's starting to close off.
Well, I'll move your diverticulectomy.
Or maybe Dr. Stark has time for it.
Dr. Stark has time for what?
Uh, I've got a diverticulectomy.
We're hoping that you could take it, 'cause this hygroma needs to come out right away.
Oh, good lord. Why did you wait so long?
This thing is a time bomb.
We just saw the patient for the first time today.
Well, so what, the parents don't have health insurance?
They do.
Well, why didn't they get this kid to a doctor?
Kyle's mother has Alzheimer's.
She was diagnosed a few months ago, and the father has been working like a dog so their insurance doesn't lapse.
And Kyle's taking care of his mom as much as anyone's taking care of him.
They're just underwater right now.
Yeah, all right. Call protective services.
What? At least one of you here understood that, right?
You can't take Kyle away from his parents.
You just told me they're not caring for their son.
They are dealing with an extraordinary set of circumstances.
This happens all the time. That's why the state set up a whole department to deal with this.
You know, I've got three specialists on their way in here to look at a tumor, so I need this room. - Dr. Stark ... And you've got a surgery to perform, assuming the patient's airway is not already closed.
If it has, well, he's probably dead, and then, well, yeah, nobody has to call anybody, right?
You have to call him off.
Well, I don't know. We can call a social worker, have 'em go in and say hello, ask if they need any help.
It'll placate him.
No, because once you're in the system, it'll only get worse.
You're registered as a parent who neglects his kid. It's over.
You have to call him off.
He's my boss.
Believe me, I like it way less than you do.
This family just lost the ground under their feet.
No one likes the idea of a 10 year old taking care of his mother, but they're doing the best they can.
Maybe Derek's drug helps her.
Or she could get the placebo, and in 18 months, she doesn't even know who Kyle is.
We can't let their last couple of years together become some nightmare where they're fighting to keep Kyle in their house.
It's enough of a nightmare already.
We'll talk to him. Well, so he shoots us down.
It can't hurt to try, right?
You need me to take your diverticulectomy while you remove the boy's mass, right?
My assistant knows my schedule better than me.
Just check with her.
We think calling protective services is a bad idea.
Oh, uh, Kyle's mother may not have a lot of lucid time.
And these years are gonna be difficult, but it's all the family has, and so pulling them apart ... Do you know when protective services pulls families apart?
When the children are in danger.
When the children aren't in danger, they go away.
They do something else.
But they can have a knee-jerk reaction to certain circumstances ... What, you think they're idiots?
I am sure that they are not ... Heartless wretches?
No. - Pediatric surgeons can be heartless wretches.
Some would argue that I'm m a case in point.
But social workers, on the other hand, are bleeding hearts, all right?
They're earning peanuts, they're doing this thankless work, and then they get painted as, what, home wreckers?
For simply for stepping in where children are being harmed.
Yeah, but the boy is not being harmed.
And you're sure about that, right? You're 100% sure?
No shadow of a doubt there?
Ah. That must be a nice feeling, huh?
Why don't you be a good example for your residents and make the call?
Mm.
What are you writing?
Dr. Bailey?
I'm writing about your ears.
What about them?
There's nothing wrong with 'em.
Well, then can I go home now?
No, ma'am.
Oh, we are wasting everyone's time.
I tripped at the pharmacy. I have faulty shoes.
I should not be trying to tone my derriere.
That flavor of vanity is unbecoming in a woman my age.
The supermarket.
Excuse me?
You tripped at the supermarket, not the pharmacy.
Whatever. The pharmacy aisle.
I ... needed some cough syrup.
You don't have a cough.
Uh, can you breathe into this tube for me?
I've had an alcoholic husband long enough.
I know a breathalyzer when I see one.
Just breathe into the tube, please.
My husband sent you in here to test me for inner ear problems and balance issues.
Well, you don't have inner ear problems.
You don't have balance issues.
You are having accidents and you are inconsistent with your description of the accidents.
And those behaviors are consistent with substance abuse.
So I will run a tox screen, I would like a list of the prescription drugs in your possession, and I need you to breathe into this tube.
The miscarriage rate is lower.
It's even lower with wildly talented O. B. s, and we have wildly talented O. B. s.
It's a risk no matter who does it.
Okay, you know what? I'm trying to eat, which is more important than it's ever been now, because I'm an incubator.
Okay, I know what each of you thinks, I'm weigthing the options, I will decide.
You'll decide?
Yes, I'm the tiebreaker.
And anyhow, I have the bigger vote, because as we've discussed, I vote on behalf of the baby and on behalf of the ... v*g1n*.
Yeah.
Right. That's not gonna cut it, okay?
We're co-parenting, all of us.
This isn't a joke.
It's not some cute arrangement where you humor me and use me for babysitting when you want to see a movie.
This is my child. We're doing this together.
You don't get a bigger vote. I'm a parent!
Daddy's mad.
So he says we're only gonna have one sink in the bathroom, like he's hurting me.
I mean, why do you need two?
Well, 'cause men leave wads of toothpaste in the sin.
And if you have your own sink, you don't have to look at it, all dried and congealed ... and filled with their fossilized oral bacteria.
I leave toothpaste in the sink.
Are you supposed to rinse it every time you brush?
Nobody parented you. This is to be expected.
You're really gonna move out and sell your house?
Are you gonna miss me?
No, I'm gonna miss having a cheap place to live.
You know, I have trouble seeing fine print, but I can still see your paws on my food.
Ooh.
The fact that the two of you haven't swapped a live-threatening infection already is a miracle.
So ... so maybe God has a soft spot for you guys.
But once this transplant is done, Ricky will be on immunosuppressants ... Ten times more likely to get an infection.
Lots of things are risky.
This is suicide.
You don't know that.
It doesn't mean anything to you. You've been happy.
We've been sick our whole lives. Don't we deserve some happiness?
You'll get it.
Don't act like it's easy, with your gorgeous eyes and your white coat.
It's insulting.
I won't tell you it's easy. It's not, but people need these lungs.
People can use these lungs for decades ... Parents with small children, teenagers who are just starting their lives.
If the two of you stay together, you could destroy those lungs within months.
These lungs are a gift. If you squander it ... What we have is a gift.
Do you love someone?
If you do ... you know.
It's rare and it's a gift.
End the relationship, or you don't get the lungs.
So it's a cyst, and it's pushing on Kyle's airway, so we should remove it as soon as possible.
But once it's out, he'll be fine.
And Dr. Robbins is great. .
Also, a social worker may be coming by just to talk to you and see how things have been going.
Is that part of the clinical trial?
No. It's more of a formality than anything.
Yeah, thank you, but, no.
Well, if ... if it's part of the experiment, we should do whatever ... No, they're worried about Kyle, okay?
It's not part of the experiment.
Wh ... why?
Ky ... Kyle's fine. You just said that he's ... he's ... If we refuse, what happens?
Wait, wait.
Wh ... what's wrong with Kyle?
No, they ... they think that we're not taking care of him.
What?
I'm fine. I don't need anything.
What ... what are you doing? I'm not doing this. - No, Allison ... I don't want to stay here.
Allison, honey, stay in the bed.
Allison, stay in the bed.
I don't ... I don't ... I don't want them to touch my son!
I understand, but ... I don't want this!
No, we are taking care of our son!
? Keep a a close watch on ?
* this heart of mine *
I don't want to be here.
♪ I keep my eyes wide open all the time ♪
Allison, listen. You need the surgery.
This is ***!
Don't let them touch our son!
All right, but ... Please! Just take me home!
♪ because you're mine ♪
♪ I walk the line ♪
♪ I find it very, very easy to be true ♪
♪ I find myself alone when each day is through ♪
She loves Johnny Cash.
He does this, and it ... always calms her down.
I need an answer.
Is it over?
Yeah. It's over.
Okay.
Okay.
You need to say good-bye.
Right now.
This minute?
We need to prep you and then cut your chest open.
So, yes ... this minute.
Hey, hey, Meredith.
Um, what was the deal with Adele Webber when you saw her a few weeks back?
Oh, she fractured her wrist.
Yeah, but you ordered a head C.T.
Just to be sure, and it was clear.
Okay, I read the file. What I'm asking for is a more complete impression of the patient.
I myself just accused her of being either a wino or a junkie, and that seems not to be the case
'cause the tox screen was clear and so was the breathalyzer.
So I'm wondering what the hell is going on.
She fell down, and she couldn't get her story straight.
I tried to talk to the chief, and he got very angry with me because I suggested that there was some indication of early dementia.
And he thinks, because I'm on Derek's study, that I see Alzheimer's everywhere.
Are you concerned?
Yeah.
Did you really call the chief's wife a wino?
My finest moment.
I am so grateful you're not trying to knock me up.
You're welcome.
The three musketeers are all freaked out about having an amnio, and Meredith is getting shot up every day with fertility drugs.
It is a nighghtmare, the whole thing.
And all for what? Just to sign up for, uh, two years of sleep deprivation and feces?
I'm so happy we're never gonna have to deal with that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well ... I want the amnio.
I just ... I want to have the information, whatever it is.
That doesn't mean I'm gonna act on it. It just ... I ... whatever the situation is, I want to know about it.
Okay.
Thank you.
That's it?
Well, I just wanted her to think about it.
I wanted all of us to really think about it.
And you did.
There's three of us. I got out voted.
As long as my 33%
is considered and nobody's body parts get more a vote than I do, that's all I can ask for.
All right, Allison, the anesthetic is in.
I just need to make a slight incision, and we should be good to go, okay?
Yep.
TO RECEIVE: ACTIVE AGENT
All right. Good.
You want to celebrate by drilling some burr holes?
I would love to.
Okay, on the black Mark.
Easy in, easy out.
Ready?
What's the matter? Just go ahead and start.
I can't.
Can't what?
I can't see it.
They're lying.
She's just gonna lay low for a couple of weeks, and then they're gonna get back together and destroy this perfectly good pair of lungs.
She's probably still in the hospital.
You want to stop the transplant?
It's too late. Lungs are on their way.
The clock's already ticking.
Maybe it'll be okay.
You know, m ... maybe it's not a waste.
They love each other. It ... it is rare.
What if they are soul mates?
And you're thinking about Sloan again.
No. Why?
He told Callie that he would be happy to raise a special needs child. Okay?
He's a good man.
I didn't think about it when I walked away.
I just got mad and I walked.
You did think about it. You think about everything.
Okay, what if I was wrong?
You really want to be dating a guy, two women, and a baby?
Okay, well, that sounds bad.
You think?
Doctor.
Yeah.
Uh, I said I'm never having kids, and you said "yeah, yeah, yeah."
Uh, what exactly does
"yeah, yeah, yeah" mean?
Well, of course you don't want to have kids. You're a resident.
I felt the same when I was starting out, so I figured we could, uh, revisit this conversation down the line.
We already discussed this.
Yes, but people change.
And it's possible, in a couple of years, you'll come around.
When have you ever known me to come around?
The idea that your career is the only thing that will ever matter to you is frankly a young person's notion.
And after what you've been through these last few months, I would've thought you'd have a more ... nuanced vision of this whole thing already.
Okay, so ... so ... so you assumed that I was gonna grow up and that I'm going to get over my childish vision of my life?
Well, that's one way to put it.
I also thought that you might find a little room for my vision of life.
Well, I've grown up as much as I plan to.
And ... I don't come around.
Dr. Avery.
Ready?
Yep. Here you go.
Okay.
Got it.
Got it? Great. Pickups and potts scissors.
Dr. Grey, bring 'em over.
God, they're beautiful.
He wastes these, I swear to God, I'll kill him. .
Are you still gonna love me if I'm blind or does it all go out the window if I'm not a surgeon anymore?
It ... it's not funny.
I don't know how you went into my O.R. and didn't say anything.
It wasn't intentional.
It started out as fuzziness in the morning.
And then I didn't see the big black spot until I started staring at Allison's skull.
Metzger's gonna meet you in ophthalmology as soon as he's out of surgery.
He could be a while, so cancel the rest of your day.
And you need to stop the fertility drugs right away.
I can't. I mean, there's two pills left in this cycle.
My egg's about to drop. I can't stop now.
Yes, you can. Okay, you know all the scary side effects they list on the side of the box?
One of them is happening to you. You need to make sure this doesn't permanently damage your eyesight.
This cycle's over.
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
The lungs are in.
So far, so good.
Gonna tell her I'm here?
Dr. Altman? No.
No, I'm pretty sure you're gonna leave.
Here's the thing ... you're killing him.
You're taking a gun and killing him.
And there is nothing romantic about a joint suicide.
It's cruel ... to you, to him, to your parents, and to the family that just buried someone.
Those lungs are gorgeous.
You can't do this.
And it always feels like ... there is just one person in this world to love.
And then you find somebody else.
And it just seems crazy that you were ever worried in the first place.
You'll tell him he has to find someone?
He really has to try, 'cause ... I don't want him to be alone.
Oh, hey.
Allison Baker is in Dr. Shepherd's Alzheimer's trial.
Uh, she has to have follow-up visits every two weeks for the next three years.
We'll make Kyle come every time.
I ... I will do the exam myself every two weeks.
Look ... Kyle ... he's not just loved, he's cherished.
I would like you to consider putting a pin in the call to protective services.
I thought she'd already made the call.
We didn't.
Oh.
Okay.
Excuse me?
Better not stay too long. I might reconsider.
Run away, Dr. Kepner.
She's gone ... Really. I don't know how to tell him.
Well, if I had to hear something like that, I'd want to hear it from you.
Everything's clear.
Good.
Well, she's just got two left feet.
Could be. I didn't check for that.
Sir ... something's clearly wrong.
Dr. Bailey, when you're rolling down the far side of the hill, things fall apart.
Uh ... Okay, look, if it was me, and my wife was suddenly accident prone and losing track of details, I wouldn't ask the general surgeon who's only been an attending for a year to check her out.
I'd ask the neuro guy ... the very fancy, extremely good neurosurgeon who happens to be studying neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's, who happens to be a close friend.
That's who I'd ask.
But that's just me.
I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Ricky's not, that's for sure.
I told Julia that she'd find somebody else.
But ... I'm not sure I believed it.
She will.
Yeah, well, what if he's her ... Soul mate?
You gotta be kidding me with this crap, Lexie.
Nobody has just one soul mate.
That'd be such a dumb system.
Look, Ricky and Julia deserve better than someone who makes them sick.
You deserve better, too.
And there is more than one soul m m me for everyone.
And someone like you?
There'd be a line out the door as soon as word got out.
Oh, would you be in the line?
Yeah.
I'm in the line.
I think I have veto power.
I mean, I think you don't bring a human being into this world if one of the parties, like the mother, doesn't want it.
I mean, what's there left to discuss?
All right. Let me, uh, get this straight.
You've made a decision, and I have no say. Zero.
So what if I think having a family is a huge part of what it means to be alive?
Well, then you married the wrong person.
Oh.
You know, maybe you did. I mean, it was ... it was hasty.
I was a P. T. S. D. wastoid, shivering on the couch. I ... Maybe we didn't think this through.
Stop it.
You don't get to pull that crap with me.
We got married, not because you're a basket case, but because we l loved each other and we wanted a life together.
So you don't get to threaten walking out just because I had the gall to express an opinion that is different to yours.
You need to think about it.
You have an obligation to at least pretend that you care what the hell I want.
Oh, these are all done. There's just two more.
I'd like you to join me for dinner.
Come again?
Dinner.
Uh, right now?
No, I already ate.
I'm just saying, some other night.
Like ... Just, you know, I mean a date.
Did you say you wouldn't call child services because you wanted to go out with me?
No. No, actually ... I wanted to go out with you because you convinced me not to call child services, and nobody has changed my mind in ... ten years.
Is that a selling point?
It cuts both ways, no doubt about it.
If I say no, will you stop giving me surgeries?
No. Come on. That's sexual harassment.
That's not my style.
Look, just think it over.
If the answer's no, that's fine.
I mean, we'll probably, uh, have to avoid eye contact for a while, but I mean, we can still work together.
Anyway ... think about it.
I gotta tell you, I was impressed with Mark today.
He ... he is really being an adult about all this.
I think that he's gonna be a great dad.
Yeah.
Right?
It'll work.
You didn't think it was ... that impressive.
Sure.
He handled it, and not like a 4 year old.
Is that supposed to make me excited?
I thought I was supposed to be the cranky, hormonal one.
I'm not cranky.
Mm.
I don't get excited about Mark.
I'm not delighted by Mark.
I love you.
And I can honestly say that I'm gonna love this baby.
But Mark?
I somehow ended up agreeing to a lifetime with ... Mark ... A lifetime of decisions ... bottle or sippy cup, basketball or tap, Dartmouth or Berkeley.
Christmas morning with ... Mark.
Okay.
I never picked him.
And I don't hate him, but ... I don't want a life with him.
And yet, somehow that's ... what I got.
What am I supposed to do, kick him out?
I mean, it's his kid.
Yeah, you don't need to remind me of that.
I never, ever forget that.
Okay, we're gonna go down that road again.
Okay, can we just be honest about the fact that this is some kind of bi dream come true?
I mean, you get the woman that you love and ... and the guy best friend who's also a great lay, and then you get a baby.
I mean, you get it all. And me?
This is not my dream.
My dream doesn't look like this.
Lexie!
Lexie, are you in here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, um, Stark?
Mm-Hmm.
Stark just asked me out.
Is that not the weirdest thing you've ever heard?
It's pretty weird. I'll give you that, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's weird, it's weird, it's weird.
I mean, he's ... he's old and mean. He's like the Grinch.
The Grinch asked me to dinner, and I said yes.
What? You said yes?
There is ... there is a nice man under there.
A ... April.
You think it's weird.
I ... I ... I do.
But I'm starting to come around to it.
You know, can we talk about it later?
Yeah, o ... okay.
Well, can I pee before I go?
April.
What?
Go downstairs.
This is shared space.
Just go downstairs!
Oh!
Oh, my God.
We are responsible ... with our patients.
The problem is ... we blow it all out at work.
In our own lives, we can't think things through.
We don't make the sound choice.
We did that all day at the hospital.
When it comes to ourselves, we've got nothing left.
I mean, he knows I don't want kids.
And suddenly, I'm ruining his vision of the future.
Don't talk to me about vision.
What if I never get to operate again?
You could be a bartender. I had a very good time.
Oh, yeah. The whole five hours you bartended.
Free drinks.
You stole those drinks. Joe didn't give you free drinks.
Your eyes will clear up. They will.
Uh, how's it going?
Oh, good. I'm good.
Uh, Metzger's gonna examine you every day.
Until he clears you, you don't set a foot in an O.R.
Well, I can't hold a scalpel, but I can observe, right?
No, you can't.
Did he just bench me?
Damn.
Yeah, she didn't think she needed to tell me she couldn't see.
She figured it was, you know, not relevant.
I don't know if I'm more mad at her as her husband or as her attending.
You were extraneous to the process.
Kinda like Cristina. She doesn't need to talk to me about whether we're gonna have kids.
That's nice.
Yeah.
Not only do I not have a say, she doesn't even want to discuss it.
They want to hold all the cards.
I want you to imagine for a minute what it's like trying to negotiate with two women.
Two.
That's a nightmare.
At least you guys get 50% of the vote.
I get a measly 33% ... I get 50%? With Cristina, I get maybe 10%.
Meredith won't even put anything down on the table.
She doesn't want me to vote, she simply omits the information ... leaving me with zero.
Gentlemen.
Chief.
Want to join us?
Can I, uh, offer you a 9-iron?
Yeah, I ... I can't stay.
I just need to borrow Shepherd for a minute.
Yeah, sure. What's up, chief?
And is it worth it ... being responsible?
Adele was in the E. R today.
Is she all right?
Yeah. She just, uh, she took a spill.
Nothing serious.
Mm-Hmm.
But it's the second time recently.
So I had Bailey work her up.
Nothing comes up. C.T. , everything's clean.
But she's ... foggy.
I need you to take a look.
'Cause if you take your vitamins ... Of course.
... and pay your taxes, and never cut the line, the universe still gives you people to love, and then lets them slip through your fingers like water.
And then what have you got?
Vitamins ... and nothing.Renegades. Rule breakers. Gangsters with scalpels.
This is the way we like to think of ourselves.
It makes us feel badass, sexy.
Can you wash this, too?
Jackson.
Is there anywhere you don't do it?
No?
We should go upstairs.
Yeah.
Problem is, it's not exactly true.
At heart, we're rule followers, sheep.
We don't break protocol. We follow it to a "T."
Why is there a trailer in my parking spot?
Is one of these yours? My bad.
You're living here, in a trailer in the parking lot?
Well, I'm in the race for chief resident, you know?
I get to the surgeries first. I'm here when the chief arrives.
Just get the thing out of my spot.
Okay? And move my car.
Because if we don't follow protocol, our patients die.
And then we're no longer badass.
We're just bad.
When are the two of you finally getting married?
Um, Meredith and Derek already got married, honey. Remember?
I know that. They wrote on a post-it.
I meant a real wedding ... in a church, with a white dress.
This isn't Alzheimer's, Richard.
Adele, the tests we ran last month showed findings consistent with early-onset Alzheimer's.
I was a nurse for 30 years, Derek.
I know what Alzheimer's looks like.
I also know that 20% of the people that are diagnosed with it turn out to have something else.
I don't have Alzheimer's. I don't.
So a lot of patients need time to come to terms with their diagnosis.
The same thing happened to my mother.
We don't have time.
Derek, we need to get Adele in on your trial right now.
We need her consent to even consider her.
Look, I'll take care of that. Don't worry.
We don't even know if she fits the criteria.
And the trial is full. Even the waiting list is full.
I know all of that. I also know that you'll do whatever you need to do to help my wife.
Everything looks fine. Right on track for 23 and a half weeks.
How's his size?
Oh, Mark.
It's okay. I'm used to that trick.
Its size is within the norm.
Come on. We're here. You know you want to know.
No, no, no, no. You want to know.
We prefer an element of surprise.
Callie?
Mark, we voted. 2-to-1. We're waiting.
Uh, your B. P. is borderline high. Are you feeling okay?
Oh, yeah, no. That's the nerves about the baby shower.
Ah. Yeah, it's like, um, it's like Christmas morning.
You are way too excited about this.
Hey, I have bought expensive gifts and played stupid games for every knocked-up nurse in this place.
Now it's my turn.
You're coming, right?
Arizona, you invite the O. B.
The fate of my v*g1n*'s in her hands.
Yeah. Um, 1:00 P. M. , fourth floor doctor's lounge.
I'll see if I can make it.
I'll make it.
What's that about?
Oh, the chief's in the bathroom. With an audience?
His trial funding came through this morning, and they all want on it.
Door's opening!
Quiet! Quiet! I haven't made my decision yet.
Oh, get out of the way.
Stalking a man while he's in the restroom?
I'd clean the restroom if he'd let me on this trial.
I'd live in it.
You are surgeons. If you want to impress the chief, impress him surgically.
Avery, you're with me.
So you've been all buddy-buddy with Webber lately.
I am staying out of it, but you ... You are very beautiful.
Oh, screw beautiful. I'm brilliant.
If you want to appease me, compliment my brain.
Okay.
Ah, Sonya. You ready for the big day?
You bet.
Try to shave as little of my head as possible.
It's hard enough dating with Alzheimer's.
I can't be bald, too.
I promise. You must be Tarik.
Congratulations on the marathon, by the way.
You didn't.
He's not like other doctors.
He's actually interested in his patients.
Yeah, I heard you just moved back from London.
Yeah, I came as soon as you accepted us into the trial.
I can't thank you enough.
No, I'm glad you're here. Thank you.
All right, I'm gonna let Dr. Grey get on with her work, and I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay, Mrs. Amin, I'm going to say three words to you and ask you to repeat them back to me later.
Truck. Cabin. Spoon.
Truck. Cabin. Spoon.
Okay.
Uh, what did you do for Thanksgiving last year?
Oh! I was in London visiting Tarik.
What? Why? Is that wrong?
Last year, you were at the Simmons', remember?
No. I was with you and Gavin in London.
I have that picture outside the palace.
That was three years ago, mom, before we broke up.
You really should call him.
He broke up with me. We're not getting back together.
Sorry. Out of all the things she can't remember, she still remembers the ex.
Okay, starting at 100, count backwards by 7.
100.
93.
Good morning, Clara.
Good's kind of pushing it.
I hear you.
Uh, Dr. Avery.
Clara Green ... 42, type 1 diabetic.
Eight weeks post-op from a tumor resection.
You know what? No, I'm sorry. I can't listen to the kid today.
I would like to hear from the grown-up doctor. - Sean.
I don't want to hear from the stupid kid anymore!
I want answers.
Okay, Sean, um, I know it's incredibly frustrating ... You don't know. My kids are in Iowa living with my parents.
Okay, I barely survived that house, now I'm inflicting it on my kids?
Diabetes is a bear of an illness.
Now the tumor removal was successful, but we knew it could be tough getting the insulin levels on track, and, yeah, it has been tough.
Well, that's not good enough anymore.
We are doing everything ... Sean, she's doing better than any of us expected.
You remember when we talked about how she might not make it through the surgery?
Dr. Bailey said she was prepared to roll the dice, but surgery was a gamble.
Clara rocked it.
And if she can do that, she can do anything.
You need any help today?
Robbins has her baby shower, so I'm free.
I still don't like you, Karev.
Dude.
Good-bye.
I just finished recasting the O'Connor girl.
Did you still need me to change Jason Cook's drain?
Nope. All done.
So you can handle the rest of the patients, right?
I think we got a thoracentesis in there.
Really?
Yeah. Thank you.
We're on for tonight, 7:00 reservation?
Oh, you know it.
All right.
You're gonna screw your way to the top. I'm impressed.
I am not screwing Stark.
I am not screwing Stark.
We're not even dating.
We're not even dating.
I'm serious. We're not.
Okay, maybe I thought we were at first.
But it's not like that now. We're just hanging out.
We're friends.
Yeah, naked friends.
What do you have?
Jogger found unconscious on the street. No I. D.
Dr. Yang's running the code.
Okay.
He's in V-fib.
Okay.
Clear.
You had chest pain, so you decided to go for a jog?
Ow! Oh. Sorry.
How much morphine did you give him?
10.
He shouldn't be in this much pain.
Give him more.
So what is this, a heart attack?
'Cause it sure feels like one.
I don't know.
We're gonna have to run some tests to find out.
A jog? !
Hey, it's not like I went out for a cheeseburger.
Her name is Clara Green. Now I know it's premature, but I was thinking she could be a candidate for your trial.
Look, I still don't have approval from the FDA, Bailey.
Sir, these people are desperate.
If we could just make them first on the list to give 'em something to look forward to.
Well, why not just do the surgery today?
Avery, just because a patient called you a stupid kid doesn't mean you should act like one.
She can't even take immunosuppressants without risking her tumor coming back.
She's deteriorating by the hour.
Why not apply for an emergency waiver?
Because if something goes wrong during the surgery, then it would kill the chief's chance for getting approval.
Sir, her kids are stuck in Iowa ... Dr. Avery ... With their grandparents, who are mean, sir.
Chief, Dr. Altman's paging you.
I'll call the FDA, see if we can get a waiver.
Get the patient on board.
Okay.
What? I ... Where do you want this?
What's that for?
Scrapbook station.
Put it next to that box with the glitter pens. - Oh, no, no, no.
Don't put it anywhere. We're not having a scrapbook station.
You heard Callie this morning. She wants us to go all out.
Move the table.
No, don't move the table.
Mark, this isn't a scrapbook station kind of shower.
You're wrong. Yang, tell her.
Torres wants all the girlie stuff ... Games, onesie decorating.
I have a patient.
Grey?
I can't get over the fact that you know what onesie decorating is.
I've been boning up.
That's what you do for the people you love.
Oh, bite me, Mark.
Oh, what's going on?
Are you guys fighting again?
Did you want a scrapbook station?
Oh, yeah. Of course. It's not a real shower if you don't get to take home a scrapbook.
Ooh, we should have glitter pens!
No, you can't. Because if you quit and move here, you'll get depressed and start to hate me.
Look, I have to go. Just ... Please stop calling. Good-bye.
They're ready. Can you bring the chart?
Sorry. The boyfriend thing is a little more complicated than she can handle.
So you two are still together or ... No. Why?
Well, we require the caretaker to be a full-time resident of the state of Washington.
I know that.
Okay. I mean, it's a big commitment.
And it may not feel like it now, but six months from now, a year down the road ... it can get overwhelming.
And if you think you might move back to London, if there's even the slightest chance, you need to let us know.
Look, when I came out to my family, my mother stood by me, she loved me.
And I know that may not seem like a big deal to you, but in my family, where we come from, being gay isn't something people just come to accept after a while.
It's a crime, and ... and people die because of it.
And ... and my father refused to deal with it, so he left.
He got a new wife, and my mom lost everything.
This ... this is the least I could do for her.
I'm committed to this trial, Dr. Grey.
Okay.
Now islet cells produce insulin.
We would put the cells in a device in your body, and it will act like a brand-new pancreas.
We're contacting the fda to get their approval right now.
Say yes. Okay, I ... I yelled at him this morning.
I acted like an ass ... What are the risks?
I mean, they have to be pretty serious, right?
Otherwise, the FDA
would've already approved it.
Dr. Bailey?
Y ... yeah, there are risks, of course.
I was just about to get there.
Um ... there's heavy bleeding, uh, low platelet counts, um, and stress on the liver.
But in Clara's condition, e ... especially since we've done everything else, um, this really is the best option.
Can we have some more time? Is that okay?
Oh, y ... of course. Yeah.
T ... take all the time you need.
Eli?
Go do something else.
What was that?
What was what?
I was getting to those risks.
You interrupted me to seem like I was hiding something.
Well, in my experience, doctors do hide things.
I just asked a question they didn't know to ask.
That's all.
No, that's not your job.
I think it is.
To undermine surgeons and alarm patients?
To care for patients ... that's my job.
Making sure they understand what highly experimental procedures they're signing up for seems a part of that.
Oh, I thought that was my job, you know, especially considering that I am the one who specializes in said highly experimental procedures.
Oh. Okay. I get it. You're the doctor. I'm the nurse.
I should know my place, right?
N ... okay, enough.
Um, there is a doctor-nurse protocol in this hospital for a reason.
You know it. I know it. Let's just agree to follow it.
Not if it hurts the patient.
Hey. You paged.
Yeah. Um, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it to dinner by 7:00.
These post-ops are taking me longer than I thought.
Okay, skip dinner.
Hey, you know, "From here to eternity" is on cable.
We could just grab dinner at my place.
Okay. Sounds fun.
Um, I still don't know what time I'll finish.
Karev, could you help Dr. Kepner with her patients?
Now you need my help?
Don't push me, dude.
Okay, so if you take these, then I can do the rest.
What?
The only way you'll be watching that movie is if it's playing on his bedroom ceiling.
His E. K. G. and cardiac enzymes were normal, so a heart attack seems unlikely.
We're doing a C.T. angio to rule out dissection or aneurysm.
Dr. Altman, you okay to stay on the case, considering your personal relationship?
Richard, we've been over this.
It's a business arrangement. Nothing more.
How are you feeling?
Great. Great.
Great. Great, great, great.
Painkillers finally kicked in, huh?
Well, enjoy the ride.
I've been thinking lately, and I think ... I, uh, I think I figured it out.
And ... why all of your dates go so bad.
Mm-hmm.
So, so bad.
Laughably bad.
And it's not your fault.
It's mine, 'cause I'm ... I'm not the guy on them with you.
We're ready to start.
Teddy, wait, wait.
You're my wife.
You're my wife.
Henry, um ... I'm your husband.
Let's do it. Let's be together.
I mean, look at you.
Look at your eyes.
Look at ... you're not looking at your eyes.
I could look into your eyes my whole life.
Business arrangement?
He's hopped up on painkillers.
Which just means his inhibitions are down.
Oh, come on, Richard.
Look, even if he meant what he said, I ... I don't feel that way. I ... I don't.
And scans are up.
Damn it. He's got a mass. It's close to his heart.
I'm gonna have to take it out right away.
You?
I'm not sure I should allow you in that O.R.
Let alone allow you to operate on him.
Chief, with all due respect ... I can do it.
It's an extremely delicate surgery.
I soloed on a similar surgery last month.
I nailed it ... is what you said.
Problem solved.
Yang will do the surgery. You'll supervise.
Chief ... I've made my decision, Dr. Altman.
Now if you'll excuse me.
He was gonna kick you out of the O.R.
At least this way, you get to stay in.
It's win-win.
Yay! Whoo!
Oh, thanks!
Don't feel bad. I've known Torres a long time.
She's a traditional girl, catholic.
You know, this whole baby-out-of-wedlock thing, the three parents ... it's a lot for her to swallow.
That's why I figured, the bigger shower, the better.
Oh, shut up.
Excuse me?
You're not the Callie whisperer.
And I'm not a monster for finding baby showers annoying.
Every woman who's ever had a pregnant friend hates them.
It's like a wedding.
The bridesmaids always want to strangle the bride.
It's practically a rule.
The only one who's not normal here is you for acting like you're enjoying this.
Okay, Arizona's turn.
Uh, I'm fine. I'm fine over here. Thanks.
Oh, just 'cause I'm the pregnant one doesn't mean you don't get to play.
Come on. It'll be fun.
It's what the bride wants.
I'm going.
I'm glad you came. I know it's awkward.
No, you know, it's ... it's not.
It's ... I'm ... I'm hap ... I'm happy for you, you know.
And, uh, plus, I'm seeing somebody else, so ... Really?
Yeah.
That's, uh ... good for you.
Do I know him?
I should go.
I know they're not paying you well, but this seems a little extreme.
Ah, I just moved into my own place.
I don't have time to shop. Pass me those cookies.
All these people in here, and you came to talk to me.
You like me.
No, I'm talking to you because I want something to eat, and you're in the way.
Admit it. You find me charming.
Are those pigs in a blanket?
Hot. Dirty hot.
It was good talking to you, Dr. Karev.
I say he's totally gay.
Well, if he were gay, then why would he ask April out?
No straight guy waits a whole month before making a move.
Maybe he has herpes.
That wouldn't stop a guy either. I vote gay.
I just wish he was into me, then I could be in all his cool surgeries, too.
He's not gay, he doesn't have herpes, and I'm not using him to get cool surgeries.
We have a lot to talk about, okay?
He's really interesting once you get to know him.
Which is why she's taking her pants off for him tonight.
What?
She's going to his place.
"From here to eternity" is playing on cable.
Oh, yeah.
Pants are definitely coming off.
Nobody's pants are coming off.
Movie at his place?
That's the definition of pants coming off.
Virgin's a goner.
And with an older man, too. It's very impressive.
I am not talking my pants off for Stark!
Oh, my God. That is so ugly.
Are you still blind?
I like it. It's abstract.
Check it out. Scrubs.
Yes, I will do a consult now.
You're not fooling anyone.
Chief.
Uh, Derek.
I need a favor.
Mm-hmm.
I'm applying for an emergency waiver with the FDA.
I need you to call your guy that helped you through your trial over there, see if he can push my request through.
All right. I'll see what I can do.
But you're the chief of surgery. I'm not sure how much more pull I'm gonna have.
There's always ways to work the system, Derek.
We both know that.
I can't put Adele in my trial, Richard.
I've looked at it all day.
Well, go over it again.
You're not hearing me.
I love Adele, but I can't pull a patient off the waiting list.
It could compromise the whole trial.
It could get us blacklisted by the FDA.
Look, Adele has no future without this!
Chief.
Yes.
Sorry. It, uh, it's Clara green.
You need to come now.
What happened?
Sugar bottomed out again. No response.
Why won't she wake up?
Uh, she's in a hypoglycemic coma.
Her sugar dropped too fast, so her brain doesn't have enough to feed on.
All right, sats are dropping, and she's got rales.
I'm gonna set up to intubate.
What? Wait. W ... what's going on?
Mr. Green, there's no time to wait.
Now if we're gonna try this islet cell transplant, we need to do it now. We just need your consent.
Yeah, of course. You do whatever you need to do. - All right.
Let's book an O.R.
Sir, the FDA hasn't given us the waiver.
Look, I know that.
This woman will die without this surgery.
Now book an O.R. now.
I don't understand.
Why does Dr. Yang have to do the surgery?
Well, you and I
are technically married, and the hospital doesn't allow doctors to treat family members.
Mm-hmm.
Right, because how can you stay objective?
Your feelings get in the way.
Is it wrong that I'm a little flattered that, uh, you won't operate on me?
Ahem. Dr. Yang is excellent.
And I will be there to supervise.
I'll see you in surgery.
She's into me, right?
Can I have your arm, please?
So this Karev guy, you're actually friends with him?
That's real?
Yeah. Why?
Uh, just it surprises me, is all.
I mean, you don't seem like the type of girl to put up with his whole neanderthal thing, so ... tell me. What am I missing?
You're missing a lot.
He had a girl go crazy on him.
His wife almost died, and then she walked out on him.
And then he was shot and almost bled to death in an elevator.
He's been through a lot.
So the neanderthal thing is just ... it is an act.
A well-executed one.
We are through the peritoneum and ready for the implant.
Anything from the FDA?
Nothing, chief.
Damn it.
Sir, I ... I think we should wait.
The longer we wait, the worse she gets.
I know, but ... are you sure we're doing this for the right reason, that you're not trying to prove a point to Shepherd, maybe?
I'm thinking of my patient here, Bailey.
That's all.
Hybrid device.
Implanting it in the omentum, near the large intestine loops.
I left my phone when I went to the cafeteria, she saw Gavin's name, so she picked up.
Please. You can't let her do this.
We'll talk to her. Don't worry.
What's going on, Sonya?
I'm not doing the trial.
I'm sorry if I've wasted your time.
Mom, just listen to him.
I don't have to.
I'm going home, and you're going to London. It's done.
Sonya, you were chosen from hundreds of applicants, and this surgery ... I can't guarantee anything ... But it could help.
There won't be another opportunity like this.
I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.
Please take me off your list.
She's not lucid, Dr. Shepherd. This is just the Alzheimer's.
She's already consented.
My name is Sonya Lela Amin. I was born Sonya Beshari.
My parents were Ahmed and Saleemeh Beshari.
I live at 3105 River Road.
I spent last Thanksgiving with the Simmonses, but three years before, I was in London with Gavin, who did not break up with you. You broke up with him ... last week when I got on the trial.
You did that for me, and that makes me very proud.
I raised a good son.
You are a good son.
Go back to London. Be with Gavin.
Ready to resect the tumor.
Bovie.
Slow and steady.
Any disturbance to his heart, and he could go into a hypertensive crisis.
He's pre-medicated. I'm all over it.
Steady, Yang.
I got it.
Good, good.
Now just irrigate and explore.
B. P. 's shooting up.
What did you do, Cristina?
I don't know. Suction.
Damn it, Cristina.
I got it. Don't worry.
All right. Check for residual tumor.
I am. You know, I need more light. Pickups.
Hurry up. Come on. Did you find anything?
Cristina?
Cristina, I need you to talk to me right now.
Do you need me to do this?
I need you to shut up and stop acting like a scared wife.
There, I got it. I ... I got it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ... No, no, it's ... it's okay. It's just ... Thank you.
Hey, Richard.
You know, I just did my first trial surgery without FDA approval.
Maybe they'll take my license, maybe they'll blacklist me.
You know what? I don't care. I saved a life.
Yes. Uh, Richard.
Yeah?
Someone just dropped out of my trial.
That's why you dragged me back in here ... For another test?
It's just a few questions to see if you meet the criteria, honey.
And then what?
I let Derek drill into my brain for no reason?
Look, I just did a surgery that I wasn't approved to do.
I did it because I knew I didn't have any time to wait.
The patient would've died.
It's the same for you.
You have Alzheimer's, honey.
You do. There's no time to wait to treat it.
Please take the test, baby.
Do it for me.
Fine.
I'll take the test.
Thank you.
But I'm going to pass.
That way ... you'll see I'm fine, healthy.
We're going to grow old together just like we always said.
We're going to grow old together.
What is that, a tumbleweed, a hurricane?
What's your problem?
Oh, someone threw out the gift list, and now we don't know who got what, and people are gonna think of us as the type of people who write vague and impersonal thank-you notes.
I'm not sure that's actually a type of people.
What's going on?
Arizona lost the gift list.
Yes, Mark. I lost the list.
I ... I ... I suck at this. Congratulations.
You're a better woman than I am.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's not a big deal.
Mark, can you give us a minute?
She lost the gift list, not me.
Mark.
So ... there is one more gift left to open.
Oh, I ... I didn't get you anything.
You got me a shower.
Open it.
It's a B&B a few hours away.
We leave in the morning.
But I have patients, and you have patients ... Look, look, I'm extending an olive branch here, because I know how annoying I must be to you right now.
But since I was 4 and I got that doll that craps her pants for Christmas I wanted a kid, because other than cracking bones, this ... this baby is my dream.
And I get to be insanely out of my mind happy for my dream.
But I'm not discounting your need to vomit over my insanities, so just ... let ... let me take you to the stupid B&B
for the weekend. Thank you.
What did you do for Thanksgiving last year?
Mm. Nothing.
Uh, Richard and I stayed home, ordered in Chinese, and it was lovely.
Okay.
Starting at 100, count backwards by 7.
100.
93.
86.
The Rodriguez boy had an incarcerated incisional hernia, but we did conscious sedation and were able to reduce it.
This was all while I was in surgery. I am impressed.
Well, Dr. Karev did most of it, actually.
Oh, Dr. Karev? Okay. Well, that's good to know.
I'll check to make sure it was done right.
Robert, just say thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Karev. Now go away.
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to call you that.
There's no need to apologize, Dr. Kepner.
No, no, no. It was completely unprofessional.
I promise I will never ... I completely ... Hey, April ... I'm saying, I liked it.
I ... I ... I can't make it tonight.
To ... what?
Um ... The new chief resident is getting picked soon, and ... and ... and e ... everyone is stepping up their game, so I should probably just stay late here ... work.
I'm sorry. I ... I understand.
We've got the age difference, we work together, not to mention, you are very beautiful.
But still, you know, I'd hoped you wouldn't feel the need to use work as an excuse to get out of spending time with me.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I wasn't.
I enjoy spending time with you ... Oh.
... so much.
It's just, I ... I guess, I j ... I just think of you more as a friend.
Friends. You know, we're ... We're friends.
Yeah. Well ... But that's the thing, you know?
I never wanted to be just your friend.
Good night, Dr. Kepner.
You needed to score a 26 or below to meet the criteria of the trial.
You were above that.
Well, what is it?
It's not important ... Derek.
It's 27.
One point?
You're going to deny her this because of one point?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry? No. It's good. It means I passed.
I ... I'm not sick.
I told you, Richard.
That's not what it means.
You have Alzheimer's.
Oh.
It just hasn't progressed enough to get into the trial.
But Derek said I passed.
I passed.
Meredith ... I'm okay, right?
When I asked you to repeat the three words back to me, you said "pool" instead of "spoon."
I asked you to identify my stethoscope.
It took you a while to find the word.
And I asked you where you took your honeymoon, and you said Hawaii.
But you were here, because the chief was a medical student, and he had to work.
Oh.
You're just a resident. What do you know?
What the hell do any of you know?
You work in a hospital all day around sick people and disease.
You're obsessed. That's what this is.
So I got a few answers wrong.
That's all?
It's normal to forget things at my age.
I ... You can never remember where you parked the car whenever we go to the movies, and they're not saying that you have ... It's not fair.
I finally ... It's ... We're finally happy ... you and me ... Loving each other the way we should have all these years.
And now?
It's not fair!
Don't look at me like that ... like ... like I'm damaged goods.
I ... I'm still me. I'm still here.
I'm still me. I ... Maybe ... maybe I won't be here much longer, but I'm right here, baby.
I'm right here.
You do ... I'm so scared.
I'm here, baby. Richard.
Help me. Please. I'm so scared.
You can help me.
Please. Please. Please.
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here.
Clara Green's extubated.
Her sats are 100%, and her glucose levels are stable.
No organ damage. It's working, chief.
Mm-hmm.
It's working.
Well, good, 'cause I just talked to the FDA.
They gave us a waiver.
I just heard the waiver came through.
We did it, right? You know, a good chief resident would be ... You need to pick a chief resident already.
I mean, Alex Karev is living in a trailer in the hospital parking lot.
Residents are waiting for you outside bathrooms ... Karev's living in the parking lot?
You know, your trial is up and running, and you've got things to deal with at home.
You don't need to be picking a new chief resident, too.
Let somebody else handle that.
Delegate.
Okay. I'd like you to ... No. I raised those babies.
Um, what I mean is delegate to someone else, who is not me.
Good night, Dr. Bailey.
Good night.
And, sir ... congratulations on the surgery.
It was a clean excision, and we got clean margins.
You're gonna be okay.
So what I said before ... about your eyes?
It wasn't just the painkillers.
Henry, you gotta stop.
You gotta stop talking to me about my eyes and flirting with me in front of other doctors.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay, I'm not sorry.
I meant what I said.
All of it ... if not more.
I get it.
It's a great story.
We get married to save your life, then we fall in love ... I mean, how romantic is that?
Not to mention that you are ... smart and funny and not at all hard on the eyes.
And I would be lying to say that it's never crossed my mind.
But I ... I don't feel it.
It's ... it's not real.
It's just a good story.
What's so wrong with a good story?
I'm sorry.
Did you hear back from the patient on the waiting list?
I haven't called yet.
Maybe Richard's right. It's just one point. - But it's a point that could ruin the trial for everyone else that we're trying to save.
Hmm.
Call them.
Well, I heard the good news.
Our patient's doing well.
Sorry. Your patient, doctor.
Oh, Eli. I'm tired.
Good.
Then just admit I was right so we can kiss and make up.
Not that tired.
Miranda Bailey, we are not inside the hospital.
Inside the hospital, you're the man.
That's the protocol. But outside, I'm the man.
I am the man. Me.
Now you can call me cro-magnon or old-fashioned, but that is not going to stop me from taking you home to my bed tonight and showing you what kind of man I am.
Now how's that? Does that protocol suit you?
Yeah.
Good.
Mmm.
Be at my place in 15.
Hey.
This is your new place.
You hungry? I got, uh, crab cakes, uh, cucumber sandwiches.
You ate all the pigs in a blanket, so ... I'll take a beer.
So this was your plan ... Wait for me on the stoop of your trailer you squat in?
What?
You were waiting for me, 'cause you find me charming.
Hot?
What? No, I, uh, I was just ... And now you're stuttering because I intimidate you.
Whatever.
Which explains it, really.
Why you haven't made a move this whole time.
Oh, that's complete bull.
And now ... you're forcing me to do it.
So was I right?
Okay.
Do you mind?
Nope.
Although, if it were me, and I had someone to make out with, I might want to do it in private, like in a room, where there's a door that locks.
Okay. Let's go upstairs.
It's every doctor's dilemma ... do you play it safe and follow protocol ... Yep. Actual real dinner.
In honor of me rocking my surgery today.
If Webber doesn't pick me for chief resident, he's an idiot.
Or take a risk and invent a new one?
Cristina.
Yes, darling?
Um ... Richard just asked me to take over picking the chief resident.
The surprise of our glory
Oh, my God. This is awesome.
You can ... Oh, my God. This is ... this sucks. This sucks.
You can't ... you can't pick me.
Everyone's gonna say it's 'cause you're my husband.
This ... no! No! What? Oh, no.
This is ... what? Oh, God. How can you eat? !
This is not fair! Wait. Wait. Wait. No.
No, no, this ... no.
There can be reward in risk.
There can also be fallout.
We've been gone all of ten minutes.
What could Mark possibly want?
I don't know.
Ohh.
Oh, y ... okay. This is ... this is bad.
He found out Lexie's with Avery. He's freaking.
Watch this.
Ah ... oh, what the hell?
Just let go.
What? This is ... this is ... This is time for us. It's just for us.
And the first thing that you want to do is talk to Mark, so ... You just said it was okay.
Okay. All right. You know what?
Screw it. No, I am gonna ... What are you doing? What are you doing?
I'm gonna talk to him!
Don't you dare call him. I ... This is jealousy, Arizona. You are jealous of Mark.
Get over it.
Well, do you ... do you blame me?
I mean, he gets most of you ... the straight you, the ... the catholic you, the girl who loves baby showers.
I just get, you know, the gay you ... oh.
Which is really only about
20 minutes a night, and not even, since you just feel too fat to even let me touch you lately.
Look, I am doing my best here to make sure that you are happy and that Mark's happy and that the tiny person growing inside me is happy.
I don't know what else I can do, to be honest.
Please tell me, 'cause I'll do it.
Whatever will make you happy, I will do it.
Still, you need to buck the system every once in a while.
Bet big.
Marry me.
What?
I ... mean it.
I love you more than ... anything.
But I want more.
I want commitments. I want rings.
So ... marry me.
And when you get the results you want?
There's no better feeling in the world.
But when you don't?Callie! Callie! Callie!
The brain is the human body's most mysterious organ. It learns ... it changes ... it adapts. It tells us what we see ... what we hear. It lets us feel love. I think it holds our soul.
Callie! Oh, Callie! Help!
Help! Somebody, call 9-1-1! Help!
Oh! Oh, no. What should we ... Go! Help me! Help! I need an ambulance ... But now matter how much research we do ...
no one can really say how all the delicate gray matter
inside our skull works.
And when it's hurt ...
when the human brain is traumatized ...
well ...
that's when it gets even more mysterious.

Dr. Montgomery, uh, there's a chance the baby could survive if we deliver by C-section while Callie is stable.
No, there's not, because not only did you fail to stop her contractions, you didn't give steroids to the baby to help mature her lungs, so you can go, too.

These are Dr. Burke's ex-patients.
Both stab wounds to the chest, both presented after their initial surgeries with D. O. E.
Now he fixed both of them percutaneously, which drastically reduces the amount of heparin needed.
So we could avoid the brain rebleeding, and we don't need hypothermia, so the baby would have a better chance ... Callie has a cardiac contusion, not penetrating trauma.
This is different.
Yeah, but I read cases where it worked in blunt trauma.
Well, I have seen every cardiac structure sheared off by the wire in the loop in that procedure.
Dr. Burke uses a technique that doesn't require the formation of a loop.
By placing an extra-stiff wire deep into the pulmonary artery, we avoided that complication.
Even if that's the case, there's embolization and hemolysis ... Which all could be avoided with a meticulous delivery technique.
It's genius.
No.
What?
I'm saying no. It's too risky in this case.
The chances that we could puncture her heart are too high.
No, I did the surgery with Burke.
I mean, he taught me. If you're unfamiliar with the technique, I can show you operative reports.
This discussion is over.
Owen?
I am head of cardio, not your husband.

Now we just have to wait for her to wake up.
And the fact that she barely responded when you weaned her off the paralytics before?
Could mean she wasn't ready to wake up.
Or?
Or it could mean her brain has been compromised, and she's not going to wake up.
You're not nothing.
We have a kid together.
You're a mom.
I'm a dad.
I'm sorry.
She's gonna wake up.
She has to wake up.
Yesterday at the baby shower ... I was jealous of Callie because she got pregnant ... without trying.
And we try.
I get shots, I take my temperature, I put my legs in the air, and nothing.
The universe says "Screw you, Meredith,"
and gives Callie a kid ... and then puts Callie through a windshield.
I mean, what the hell is going on?
What's the point?
I mean, is there a reason for this?
Because if you can think of a reason, any reason at all, why the universe is so screwed up ... and random and mean, now would be an amazingly good time to tell me, Because I really need some answers.
I know. I know. I know. Come here.
I know.
Listen ... I will make sure we have a baby. I promise you.
One way or another, you and I will be parents. I promise you.
Okay?
She's-she's really small.
But she's strong.
She's 1 pound, 1 ounce of ... strong.
Fighting against all the ... complications.
She's got beautiful black hair, Calliope, beautiful hair.

Oh, oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Callie.
Callie.
Y-yes.
What? What?
Yes.
I'll marry you.
Yes. Yes.After a trauma your body is at its most vulnerable. Response time is critical. So you're suddenly surrounded by people ...
Go. Go. You got it.
Doctors, nurses ...
Focus. Focus.
Come on, come on, come on.
Specialists, technicians.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go.
Surgery is a team sport ...
everyone pushing for the finish line ...
All right! All right! Good job.
Yay, fingers.
Yeah. Yeah.
Putting you back together again.
Oh.
Okay. It's okay.
You're retraining your brain.
Getting your fingers straight was the goal for today, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Little goals, remember?
All right, let me get in there to check her incision.
Good morning. Baby report. Boom.
I'm gonna go see her.
Hey. You're awesome.
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme.
See?
She's moving her arm like she's waving.
She still doesn't open her eyes, but she only stopped breathing once last night. And get this ... her brain bleed's still grade 1.
Good girl.
She looks bigger.
Is she bigger?
All right. Some of us are still working.
Let me get in there, please.
Okay, I have a consult. I have to go.
How are you?
Um ... I almost got my hand straight.
That's great mm-hmm.
Yeah.
But surgery is a trauma in and of itself.
So today? I can see her today?
And once it's over, the real healing begins.
We call it recovery.
I'm sorry.
No.
But until ... No.
You can be mobilized and your infections are completely gone, you cannot see her, and she cannot leave the NICU.
Now you know
I would if I could.
Mm. Mm-hmm.
Right? You know that, ri ... Recovery is not a team sport.
Yang.
Mm-hmm.
Tell her I would.
Mm-hmm. She would if she could.
It's a solitary distance run.
Are you giving me the finger?
Yes, I am.
Good job.
It's long, it's exhausting ...
and it's lonely as hell.
Mrs. Pulcher, you're gonna have to stop smoking.
Your infections are getting worse.
Your infections, you mean.
I didn't have them before you two idiots operated.
And you didn't even do that right.
Again, I am sorry, but your lung cancer had spread to the point that we couldn't ... Please. Useless.
I can afford any hospital in the world, and I come to this third-rate crap factory.
When am I getting outta here?
I've been here for three weeks.
This is not Guantánamo.
Discharge her, please. I'll pay you.
There is not much more that we can do unless you are willing to help yourself. Now the smoking ... Oh, if I wanted a lecture on smoking, I'd dig up my dead husband.
Now get me outta here before I
sue your balls off.
Well, we'll run some tests, and if your white blood cell count is up to an acceptable level ... How high does it have to be?
Give me a number.
Well, it's at a . 8 now, and I'd like it to be above a 2.
1.
This is not a negotiation.
Everything is. 1. 5.
1. 5 and you let me outta here.
Now get me a wheelchair, 'cause if I have to wait around this hellhole, I'm gonna smoke.
Okay.
Oh. I smoothed out some bumps in the NICU surgery protocol if you wanna ... stop acting like a child.
You crushed his heart, April, and none of us thought he had one, that's impressive.
Yeah, well, it's inconvenient.
I need him to sign this.
Uh, morning.
Oh, good morning.
Oh, uh, another Alzheimer's trial patient today, huh?
Yes, sir.
Good, good.
How is your islet cell trial going?
Have you found a resident to assist you?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Avery's gonna help me out today.
Great. Good.
And, uh, Mrs. Webber, how is she feeling?
Uh, she's doing all right. Thank ... thank you.
Oh, sir.
You ... Wow. That kids looks screwed.
He is.
He has five different cardiac and abdominal defects.
I'm supposed to operate on him next week.
That's awesome. Can I scrub in?
Yeah, if you can get us to Africa.
Hmm?
I was supposed to go back there next week, but now I have a very sick little girl of my own and a fiancée in the I.C.U.
Fly him out here.
Yeah, I've tried, but you can't imagine the red tape and the money.
And there's a dozen more like him that I'd want to do the same thing for.
Trying to find someone to help 'em out over there.
I just ... I made a promise, that's all.
Hey, it's healing pretty well, and maybe in a couple of days, you can try sitting up by yourself.
Let's try now.
Can't rush it.
Why'd I get you?
Why aren't you cutting out a heart somewhere?
Well, Altman and I had a falling out, over your ventricular septal defect, actually.
Mm. I'm just giving her some space.
Okay, you're good. Okay, you need anything?
I need to see my baby.
She's mostly tubes and wires.
And she looks more like a chicken than a baby ... Like a ... like a featherless, beakless chicken.
You want to wait till she's cuter.
You're the worst godmother ever.
You picked me.
She opened her eyes.
Sofia ... she ... she looked right at me.
I saw her sweet little eyes. They ... they're beautiful.
They look just like yours. Oh, my god!
I shoulda taken pictures. Why didn't I do that?
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, god, no. I'm so sorry.
Go, go, go, go, get the pictures!
Okay.
Go get the pictures then.
I'm sorry. Oh, oh, god.
Callie.
Callie.
No, don't. Callie.
Callie, stop it. Stop it. Stop it, Callie!
You'll rupture your sutures.
I am missing her.
I know.
I'm missing her.
I know. I know, honey. I know.
She could die, and I'll never ... I could miss her whole life!
Shh. Okay, okay. Easy, easy, relax.
Lie back down.
Oh!
Pulse is 102.
Are you nervous, Ed?
Yeah, it's kinda like going to the dentist, only worse.
Well, this is gonna be over before you even know it starts.
Mm-hmm.
Dr. Grey is gonna do the drill now.
You're not gonna feel anything, though.
Ed, try and relax, okay?
I can't.
All right, stop. Stop it. Just pull back.
All right. Let's get the halo off. He's having an M. I.
Okay.
Flatline.
What the hell happened?
His E. K. G. was fine?
Mm-hmm. He never complained of chest pain.
I did the workup. There was nothing in his history.
It wasn't your fault. It was a massive M. I.
After we inform Mr. Beckert's family, I will call the F. D. A. and file a formal report.
Is there a chance they could shut down the trial?
Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna shut it down, pending the autopsy.
I want to know why we didn't see it coming.
I thought Dr. Bailey said Torres can't be moved yet.
Yes, sir, but since she has had no contact with the baby, I was wondering how soon we might be able to ... Bring the baby to Torres?
I think it'll do the both of them good.
Uh, if I could at least tell Dr. Torres when she ... When the baby is off the vent, when she has an immune system and can withstand the onslaught of deadly infections
Dr. Torres would threaten her with, that's when.
I mean, come on. I'm all for mother/baby bonding, but not when it'll kill the baby.
Why do you even ask me these things, huh?
I thought you were a doctor.
Ouch.
I need your help with something.
Oh, wait. I have, uh, patient 122's trial packet.
It was never opened, so it needs to go back into the lot.
Oh, okay. One sec.
I heard about your patient. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
You, too.
Henry, will you open the door?
I'm sorry. The place is, uh ... You were just supposed to tell me if this is normal or if I need to ... if need to go to the hospital.
You know what? Will you just sit down and be quiet?
All right.
Did you check your blood sugar?
Uh, 56, but I don't have, uh, any juice.
I just have, uh, half a can of diet soda, so ... Okay, okay.
Oh, damn it. Look at you.
What?
You look amazing. You were on a date, weren't you?
I made you come here in the middle of a date.
No, no, no, you know what? Actually, you saved me from the longest date with the most tedious man.
The only good thing that came out of the date were these cannolis, which, as it turns out, is exactly what someone needs when they're having a hypoglycemic Episode .
But you still shouldn't have come.
Yeah, you know what?
You'll stop saying that once you try this.
Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Good.
Okay. Tell me about this date.
Uh, well, mm, his name is Erwin.
Ooh.
Okay, so strike one.
No!
Give me that.
So am I leaving? What's my number?
It's not good.
Not your opinion, stupid. Number.
. 6.
It's gone down.
I'm sorry the results weren't better.
You should be, you worthless b*st*rd.
It's all your fault. Get outta my sight.
I can't stand looking at your stupid face.
Go!
How'd she take it, Karev?
Bitchy, 'cause she's a bitch.
She's also dying and she's alone.
She hasn't had any family or visitors since she got here.
Well, maybe that's 'cause she's ... Let's keep our assessments to ourselves.
Karev, what's your plan for chief resident?
My plan?
Mm-hmm, besides badmouthing patients.
All your colleagues are showing some kind of leadership potential.
Grey and Avery, they're on clinical trials, Kepner is overhauling the surgical checklist.
They have a plan.
I was just wondering if you had a ... African kids.
Sorry?
Yeah, I'm gonna bring over about a dozen kids from Africa and, uh, get them surgeries ... badly needed surgeries.
Huh. Sounds pretty ambitious.
Well, I'm am ambitious guy.
Also sounds like you just pulled that outta your butt.
Oh, no, sir, it's a ... it's a plan that I've, uh, been plan ... planning.
Okay. Well, good.
Let me know if I can help.
Right outta your butt.
Shut up.
You guys ready? Let's do this.
Wake up!
What?
Just lay still and relax. Let us do everything.
Can you do that?
Tell him that chole moved to 8:30 tomorrow.
Back, back, back.
Okay.
Dr. Bailey.
Can I ... can I ask you something?
Well, what is it?
Uh, h-how's your day going?
How's my day going?
Uh, my day should've ended three hours ago.
I'm tired, it's late, and I still have six more things to do before it's over, and now I have you in my face asking me how my day is going.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
We'll give you some privacy.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi, baby.
Don't worry.
See, I'm ... I'm a little messed up, too.
But we're gonna be fine, okay?
We're gonna be just fine.
Hey.
Hey, how is Mr. Beckert's wife?
Uh, her kids took her home.
I can't believe they lied to us.
They didn't lie.
They just left out the history of his heart problems because they needed this trial.
Now while we're waiting for the F. D. A. to respond, I want to rescreen all the applicants with a fine-tooth comb.
Is that what you're doing now?
No. As morbid as it sounds, I am trying to find a replacement for Mr. Beckert.
A new patient 122?
Yeah, we'll need to have one ready.
Okay. So what about Adele Webber?
Meredith, you know I want to, but she's just not far enough along.
Her disease has not progressed enough for her to be eligible for this trial. You know that.
Well, this fell off of Richard's sweater this morning.
Breathe.
Breathe.
No. She can't talk to me like that.
I'm a trained professional, and she's an uncooperative, insulting ... Fiancée of mine, so let's just ... let's watch it.
He's a wuss. Let him go.
Good luck.
That's the third one this month.
They don't push me hard enough.
It's a traumatic brain injury.
It's not boot camp.
Yeah, we're getting married.
You want me walking down the aisle, not rolling, right?
I want you healed. It's okay. I mean, the wedding ... Oh!
Oh! Sorry. I'm sorry.
The baby won't wait.
You can pick her up. You can hold the baby.
Mark can hold the baby. I can't hold my baby!
Don't tell me it's okay!
I'm sorry.
Then bring me those balls, please.
I've got, uh, eight patients lined up from three African countries, all through the Namboze clinic.
There's a, um ... Oh, wait.
Jeez. Ah, here.
A cardiac defect, uh, a brain tumor, an idiopathic gangrene case ... I mean, when do we get to see that, right?
What else? Oh, and, uh, Hunt, He-he-he got me in touch with, uh, a military guy about ground transport and he also volunteered to operate pro bono, so I've got him and Robbins, Bailey, uh, Sloan, Shepherd ... Stop.
How you gonna pay for all this?
Well, that's why I'm talking to you.
You're the chief of ... of peds surgery.
I mean, they're incredible surgeries ... on kids.
Oh, oh, oh, okay. So it's ... it's coming out of my budget?
Well, I'm saying, if ... if I do all the logistical crap, I mean, it's a ... it's a project the hospital should fund, right?
I mean, it's-it's worth ... Nothing.
That's what it's worth. No, no.
I'm sorry.
Right. I should've known what you'd say.
No, no, no. You don't get to do that.
You don't get to ask me to fund a plan this half-assed and then paint me as somebody who wants to deny ... health care to third-world kids.
Come on.
I mean, yeah, there are people that can do this sort of thing, but ... you're not one of 'em.
Mrs. Pulcher.
Oh, ooh. Is it two hours already?
Ow. It seems like I saw your slack jaw a minute ago.
I feel like I just saw your blistery old butt.
Oh, no. You can't speak to me like that.
You can't speak to me like that.
I should sue you ... 10 grand for every bedsore on my ass.
I'll die before I ever see any of that money, but I'll ... But you'll die rich.
Richer thanks to you dumbasses.
Or you could do something good with the money.
Donate it to a good cause, help someone out.
Or put it to getting you a medical degree.
Mrs. Pulcher, I have a plan to bring some African kids over here ... Oh.
For some really cool ... I mean ... desperately needed surgeries.
You askin' me for money?
I need at least 100 grand to get things started.
Oh, my god.
Take it somewhere else, Sally Struthers, and get outta my face.
Overall, Adele scored a 23, which is a marked decline from the last time we tested her, which was 27.
Mm-hmm. So she's definitely a lot worse than we thought.
Well, the upside is, she gets in the trial.
But she's declining so fast.
I know.
Why can't we just give her the medicine on the side
Outside of the trial? Who would know?
No. The F. D. A. is gonna be on us harder than ever.
Anything we do that taints the results could ruin the trial, and not to mention our careers along with it.
Don't think I haven't thought about it.
She's in heart failure.
She's gotta go back on the vent. She needs surgery now?
Well, as soon as possible.
Her ductus arteriosus hasn't closed.
Fletcher's a no-go.
I'm gonna try Terry Lennox at Seattle press.
Look, I know I'm not high on your list, but, uh, your baby's out of time, you know it can't be you.
I have performed the procedure before, so ... you're stuck with me.
I understand. I ... And, uh, although you're not technically related to the baby ... I'm sorry, what?
The hospital would have no ethical objection if I let you be in the O.R. with me.
I mean, if you'd like to look over my shoulder, you know, make you feel any better.
Thank you.
Okay. We will page you when we're ready.
Thanks.
I'll-I'll go tell Callie.
So should I get her prepped?
Yeah, looks like I'm stuck with you, too, huh?
Are you ready to go back?
Mnh-mnh. One more lap.
What, did you lose a bet?
She's my new physical therapist because she does what I tell her to.
Whose charts are those?
Altman's. She's being ridiculous.
I haven't seen a cardio surgery in a month.
So you stole her charts?
Yes, I stole her charts so I will be prepared when she comes crawling back.
Grey, sit. I need the resistance.
Oh, so I retested Adele Webber.
She's worse than we thought.
But at least she's gonna get in the trial.
Okay, see? ! See? ! I should be on this.
How do I even have a shot at chief resident if I can't do what I'm good at?
Alex, you didn't. You're gonna be fired.
I'm gonna be chief resident.
Yeah, not if you don't work here anymore.
He-he solicited a patient for money.
Oh, you hookin' now?
No, my African kid thing.
It's against so many rules.
Who cares? The old hag could die, leaving her money to save dying children.
But instead, she'll probably leave it to her cats, who probably hate her, too. Are you going to radiology?
Uh, hey, everybody. Off. Now.
Callie.
I did four laps today.
Sofia needs surgery.
What?
Today. Now. She has weakness in her left ventricle.
She needs a P. D. A. ligation.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
She's gonna be fine, and I'm gonna be there.
Oh.
What?
Callie.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, my ... Help!
Somebody help!
Abdominal wound dehiscence with a small evisceration.
She's worked herself into a rupture.
I should've seen this coming.
I should've forced her to stop walking.
I check that wound three times a day.
She never complained of pain.
Yang, I've been telling Torres to slow down for weeks.
The woman doesn't listen, so stop kicking yourself and just help me fix it.
Bovie.
How bad does it look?
How is she?
They're just starting now.
B. P. is, uh, 39 over 20.
That's way too low.
No, for a kid this small, it's fine.
You know, talking will distract me.
Uh, I'm sorry. Um, I have to hang up.
No, I didn't say hang up. Just keep it down, please. Potts.
You're dumber than you look.
I'm gonna have your job.
Nurse!
Help me, Mrs. Pulcher.
Oh. Nurse! I'm gonna call your supervisor ... You're my only hope.
And have you fired!
I need your help.
And then I'm gonna sue this hospital!
Please.
And then I'm gonna sue you!
Please.
Get out!
I don't ever want to see your face here again!
He's just getting ready to clip the P. D. A.
3-0 vicryl.
She's closing now.
No leaks, no bleeders, no sepsis.
B. P. 's good, so we're home.
What's happening?
The P. D. A. ripped.
Suction. 6-0 prolene. Now. Damn it, now.
What's happening?
What's going on, Robbins?
Oh, what happened?
I'm sorry.
If she ... I'm sorry.
You need to be in here.
You missed the good part, Dr. Robbins.
She tried to bleed out, but I wouldn't let her.
And the lung is up ... and it is beautiful.
All right. 5-0 vicryl, please.
And everybody's fine.
Okay. Let's get you ... Don't touch me.
Oh, she's been asking for you.
Get in here.
This ham-fisted twit doesn't know how to roll me.
You asked me not to come back.
I'm only ... Just shut your hole and get in here before this idiot breaks my spine.
100 grand.
What? !
Alex, don't.
Give me 100 grand, and I'll come in.
Mrs. Pulcher, he's-he's joking.
He-he doesn't ... he doesn't mean that.
$50, 000.
$100, 000.
$75, 000.
100 grand, final offer.
You don't know how to negotiate.
I'm not negotiating.
Oh, don't pretend to be smart, you crooked little b*st*rd.
And don't pretend you're poor, you evil old bitch.
100 grand.
Done. 100 grand.
Now get in here and roll me over.
Wait. He made you pay for parking, too?
Smooth.
Yeah, and that was all before dinner.
You gotta try this pasta. It's ridiculous.
I'm in.
Did I tell you that his hair was longer than mine?
No. No.
You know what's funny?
I don't know why his online photo didn't feature his very, very long ponytail.
I love this guy.
Mm.
Mmm. Mmm.
This is so good.
Meet us a Joe's. I'm buying.
What's up?
$100, 000 is what's up, courtesy of the dragon lady in room 10-22.
Alex.
You know what happens when you break the rules, Mer?
You get 100, 000 bucks. Drinks are on me.
I can't. I'm on call.
No. No! No!
No! Time of death, 21:44.
No. Shut up. No.
She had an arrhythmia.
Well, get her back. I need her.
Alex!
I had it. I had it!
I'm sorry.
No, I had it. I had it!
You bitch.
Mrs. Webber.
Hmm?
What are you doing here so late?
Oh, you know, Richard is finishing up, and I'm just waiting.
He doesn't like to see me go home alone.
Mm. May I sit with you?
I'm surprised to see you here. You on call tonight?
Mm-hmm.
So how are you feeling?
You really want to ask me that?
It's hard, I know.
You think so?
I only know from my side of it, from my experience.
Excuse me, but I have no use for your side of it.
I thought I could handle it, thought I could live with it ... it was only temporary ... that it was gonna go away, but clearly, I was wrong.
It's just getting worse.
I'm sorry.
Are you? Are you really?
Then stop.
Please, just stop.
Are you in love with him?
If you're in love with him, I don't know what you should do.
But I think ... god help me ... Ellis, I think he's in love with you.
And if you're not, please ... give him back.
Adele, it's ... it's Meredith.
Not Ellis.
It's Meredith. I'm her daughter.
Ellis is gone. She died.
Please give me back my husband.
Please ... give me back my husband.
Uh, he's-he's-he's yours. He's-he's all yours.
Good morning.
Oh, yeah. Look at you.
Look at how big you are.
Hey, I was just coming to see you.
Not you. Her.
Good morning, beautiful.
Are you gonna tell me to get back in bed?
'Cause I just got here. I am not.
I was coming to tell you to go home.
Don't drop that baby.
To what? To what?
Go home.
When?
Now.
Oh ... Look, look, your vitals are stable, your balance is good, and you obviously are strong enough to carry this one around, So go ... Get out.
Did you hear that?
We're going home.
Wait.
I'm going home.
It's 500 bucks to get it out of impound.
Oh, come on.
You shoulda paid the tickets. Have a nice day.
I will see you as soon as you are done.
Meredith, make him stop fussing over me.
Okay, I'll be right there.
So she's going into surgery right after the M.R.I. , so don't worry.
Uh, Meredith.
Thank you for everything you've done.
I didn't really do anything. The circumstances changed.
You did. You caught it first.
And the minute you did, you looked after her.
You did everything you could to take care of her.
I've made a lot of mistakes, and it's taken me a lot of years to finally realize that all I want to do is be with her.
You've given us the best chance that we could get.
You've done everything.
What's this?
What's this? It's your kid.
Your African kid.
Oh, that's happening?
Today?
Tonight. The first group gets here tonight.
I've been telling you this all week.
Look, each of you gets your own kid.
Some of them will be traveling with family, a few of them are orphans, so you are in charge of your kid, right?
You're like their ... their ambassador.
Wait. You can't have her. You'd be awful to her.
Um, him. No. Yes, him.
He's melting down.
Train wreck.
Evil spawn is now mother Teresa.
Don't forget, they get here tonight!
Karev. They're here.
They just touched down in D.C. , and they're gonna change planes and have dinner, and then they'll be here.
You did it. You know, I never thought you would.
I didn't think you could, but ... you did.
Well done, Karev.
See?
I am in so much trouble.
Oh, my ... Oh, my god. How ... How did you let this happen?
It just happened.
I asked for things, and-and-and people started saying yes.
And-and I-I paid for it myself at first, but then I maxed out my cards, but the ball was rolling and-and planes were reserved and-and a freakin' military transport.
I mean, what am I supposed to say, "Sorry. Never mind."
"Lack of funds. Keep your dying kids where they are"?
Well, yeah.
No. You say "I'll pay you when you get here."
"Keep the receipt. Send me the bill."
And now, I mean ... Oh, god.
Right now they're eating
$8 airport hamburgers that I can't pay for.
Alex, this ... I mean, this is ... this fraud.
You have actually grifted people.
I can't do this.
Well, yeah, well, you ... you have to now.
I mean, you already did it.
You-you could go to jail for th ... this.
Ah. There you are.
Here's your kid. They're coming tonight.
Um, okay. Uh, hold it for me be ... Look, just take it.
Well ... She's a 5 year old with optic glioma ... What are you doing?
I'm working.
No, what are you doing?
Oh, Alex. This is from a lawyer.
Ah.
No, take it. You have to ... No, I don't ... I don't want to see it.
Look, they're gonna get here tonight, Lexie.
I-I ... they'll get their surgeries. I'll go to jail.
I don't even care anymore.
Just ... no, no, don't! It's a check.
It's a check for $200, 000 from the estate of Gladys Pulcher.
It's from the dragon lady.
That bitch.
Okay, Adele.
I need you to take a couple of deep breaths for me, okay?
You okay?
I'm fine.
Good.
All right.
Okay, I'm gonna make ... the injection.
And, uh, you shouldn't feel this.
There it is.
Hi.
I really don't want to go home until she goes, you know?
Um, and clearly, she's not ready to go, so ... Shh. Shh, shh.
She can go.
What?
With most parents, I'd say no, but she has three doctors at home, so if she passes the infant carrier test ... Uh, what test?
Uh, she has to sit in an infant carrier for an hour with no apnea or bradycardia.
Oh, she'll nail that. I'll go get it.
Thank you.
Well, yeah, it's-it's okay.
I mean, if she passes the test, it's okay.
People are talking about you ... kindly.
They're-they're saying you're kind, funny, compassionate.
And Dr. Robbins has a lot of nice things to say about you.
I'm just glad, you know.
I'm-I'm glad that people are getting to know the Robert that I got to know and like.
You deserve for people to like you.
It's Dr. Stark.
How'd it go?
Actually, it's still kinda going.
What? What do you mean?
Well, it was this guy that I had met before, and now he's back in town, and it's kinda great.
Oh, and they had that pasta that you love, and well, I didn't wanna ... so, um, well, here.
Oh, you didn't ha ... th ... thank you.
Yeah.
So, um ... I'm sorry I-I can't stay.
No. No, this is great. You should go.
Yeah?
Yeah, go.
Okay. All right. I'll call you.
All right.
Okay, good.
How's your friend?
Good. Thanks. It was good that we stopped.
Glad to do it.
So ... What's next?
Am I taking you home?
Or I might be taking you home.
The length of your recovery
is determined by the extent of your injuries ...
Five more seconds.
Five ... four, three, two, one.
That's one hour.
Yay!
You did it, big girl.
Aww.
I can't believe she's leaving.
Yeah. Yeah, she's cute, isn't she?
No. Callie.
Okay.
She was my last cardio patient.
Does Teddy even talk about me?
That's a cute baby, right?
Its small features and oversized eyes trigger a hormonal response in humans.
It's autonomic. It's what keeps us from eating them.
And it's not always successful.
For the grad wall.
Okay, let's roll.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Put her down.
I have got the apnea monitor, the o-2 ... Oh, Callie, you need to steal some of those NICU blankets.
They're the best.
Okay, everybody, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
No matter how hard we work at it ...
She's not ready. No, she can't leave.
She's-she's been watched by doctors 24 hours a day.
She still will.
Okay, well, her lungs ... she could get R. S. V.
Well, any kid could get R. S. V.
She's not getting in a car. It's not safe.
Some wounds might never fully heal ...
Callie ... It's not safe.
The last time she was in a car, she nearly died.
We both nearly died. Get-get her outta that thing.
Honey ... Get her ... give her ... give her to me, Mark. I'm not kidding.
Get her out of that thing. Give her to me.
Oh, Callie. Callie.
Come here. Come here.
Cal ... O-okay, okay, you're right.
You are absolutely right.
Cars are not safe for children.
Okay, neither are bookcases, or squirrels, uh, strong winds, uh, people who sneeze.
They're all gonna get your baby.
But, honey, you don't feel this way because you were in an accident.
You feel this way because you are a parent.
It'll pass, mostly.
Some of it never will.
You might have to adjust to a whole new way of living.
Things may have changed too radically ...
I wish I could tell him.
What?
Richard.
I wish I could tell him his Adele got the medicine.
I just hate keeping it from him.
To ever go back to what they were.
Me, too.
I need a wheelchair.
Lexie, Avery.
Let's go.
It might not even recognize yourself.
It's like you haven't recovered anything at all.
You're a whole new person
with a whole new life.No, I just ... I just want to say, I'm really excited about the clinical trial.
I've been reading in the "New England journal of medicine" ... Germs, disease, toxins ...
our bodies encounter dangers all the time, just beneath the surface ...
hidden.
Whether you realize it or not, your body is constantly protecting itself.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Why is the sperm donor here?
I thought tonight was a family dinner.
Dad, I ... To two extraordinary women ... may your lives be overfilled with love, happiness, and joy.
To Callie and Arizona ... the mothers of my child.
Oh, for god sake. I ... Oh, Daniel. Cheers.
Yes. There we go.
Do you ever go by anything other than colonel, colonel?
The colonel.
Actually, um ... we forgot to say grace.
Say what?
Yeah, we should ... we should say grace before we eat.
Of course. Shame on us. Fork down, The colonel.
Mom, you want to lead?
Bless us, oh, lord, and these thy gifts ... Every time you blink your eye, you wash away thousands of unwanted microbes.
Breathe in too much unwanted pollen and you sneeze.
Amen.
I'll get her. I'll go. I'll go get her. Excuse me.
Arizona, we sat next to a charming young man on the plane today, and he said he was going with his partner to march in a parade.
For pride?
Yeah. Those are good.
Mm.
The body knows
when it's encountered something that doesn't belong.
Oh. She couldn't be cuter if she tried.
Mom, you haven't had a chance to hold her yet.
The body detects the invader, it releases its white blood cells ...
No, no, that's all right. Thank you, though. I'm eating.
And it attacks.
This is Zola. She's 6 months old, born with spina bifida ... Adorable African children, shameless ego stroking ... Karev is a genius.
Yeah, he's single-handedly stealing chief resident out from under all of us, and we're helping him do it.
I mean, we can't exactly refuse to treat little sick kids without making ourselves look bad.
Oh, he is a genius.
Or ... That's what they say in Swahili.
His spine to prevent any further brain damage ... Well, he only has a shot because I've been benched.
The playing field has been leveled. You're all welcome.
My Alzheimer's trial kicks African-orphan ass.
It kicks all of your asses.
Do you want to keep it down back there?
I'm trying to listen to what appears to be the next chief resident talking.
Before we go, I just want to say thank you to all of you for your participation.
It, uh, truly means more than I could say.
Slow clap. They're giving him the slow clap. Come on.
I'm not giving him the slow clap. Ridiculous.
Okay, I want to personally check the incision sites, any weight fluctuations, the patients' glucose levels.
When was the last time you cleaned these cages, Avery?
A clean cage means a lower infection rate, which means F. D. A. approval, understood?
Cages. I got it, sir.
Makena? Hi, I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Of course, you know Dr. Karev.
We're here to take a look at Zola today.
Uh, sometimes babies with spina bifida can develop Chiari malformation.
It causes fluid build-up in the brain.
It could be pretty uncomfortable, but sometimes, if you adjust the patient's head position ... It helps relieve the pressure.
Let me see this. Let me see this face.
We've had her at the orphanage since she was 2 months old. This is the first time she's stopped crying since I can remember.
Let's just run an M.R.I. and check to see if she has a Chiari malformation or hydrocephalus.
If it's positive, we're gonna have to do a shunt, drain the fluid.
It's gonna postpone the spinal surgery, but I think it's gonna be worth it.
I think she likes you.
She can keep that lamplight.
Sefu, I will be repairing your brother's heart defect tomorrow while Dr. Sloan, our head of plastics, he will construct Kondo a new sternum.
He wants to know, if he dies, could we wait to tell the family at home.
Our sister's birthday is tomorrow, and he doesn't want to ruin it.
We are gonna take really good care of you. Okay?
And you are not gonna ruin your sister's birthday.
We have to look at his chest, okay?
Wow.
Sir.
Get off me! I told you that I'm fine!
I don't need any help.
Sir, please.
Get ... Sir, if you continue to try to get out of bed, I'm gonna have to restrain you.
Get off me. Get off ... Aah!
B-52 cocktail. Ought to calm him down.
Okay, listen, I need to get back in the race for chief resident.
I need in on Teddy's pentalogy of Cantrell patient.
This isn't funny anymore. She is still shutting me out.
Can't you talk to her?
I thought you were on Robbins' service today.
Isn't she on that case, too?
Yeah, but that just puts me, like, inches away from some other resident doing the most amazing cardio procedure imaginable while I just stand there and ... suction. It's torture.
You need to apologize.
Apologize for what, for having better judgment than Teddy, for saving Callie's life?
There's a wedding tomorrow because of me.
Your apology could use some work.
You asked me how to get back in with Teddy.
I'm telling you how.
Ugh.
Asha is 10 years old. She sustained internal injuries six years ago from an explosive device.
She has multiple enterotomies ... And there are some strictures there and some ascites.
She has not healed properly. Boy, this complicates things.
As does the fact that she's H. I. V. positive.
She's living with A. I. D. S.
Hello.
Uh, don't be scared.
I'm just gonna take your blood pressure now, okay?
Mm. So ... oh, no. It's okay. It's okay.
Um, we're ... we're here to help.
Help.
Let's get her on L. R. at maintenance and start broad spectrum antibiotics.
Understand?
Help. Help.
Dr. Kepner ... Uh-huh.
Um, the antibiotics and the L. R. ?
Oh, right. Sorry, Dr. Hunt. Right away.
You know, Dr. Kepner.
Yeah.
Perhaps if you spent a little more time just doing your job, a little less time learning the new languages, your attendings wouldn't have to repeat themselves.
Hold, please.
Dr. Altman, I would like to apologize.
I am ... sorry for going over your head and putting you in a difficult position during Callie's surgery.
I am sorry. I-I apologize.
Are you saying this because you mean it or because you want back on my service?
Does it really matter?
Yes, it matters.
Here you go.
Thank you. Oh.
I, uh, I put together a schedule to, uh, to help with the next two days.
Ah. Oh, by the hour, military time ... Wow.
Thank you, colonel.
And I picked up a little something for Sofia.
Look at the little rosebuds.
Okay, mom, baby clothes later.
Wedding rehearsal now. I've got 20 minutes before I have to get back to the hospital.
Dad, where's the moment of silence?
Time is tight, Arizona.
I could not find a place in the ceremony for it.
Well, we have to light a candle for Timothy. It's two minutes.
Timothy?
Oh, her brother.
Ah.
Dad ... Sweetie, don't push it.
Okay, so the table is the altar, and the lamp is ... Father Brooks.
Your priest?
Minister.
No, he's not catholic, but he practices at a very big church.
It's-it's old and drafty. It's ... You'll like it.
It's very churchy.
I see.
Okay, Mrs. Torres, you'll be over here in the front row.
Okay, and I know where you want me.
Right back here to walk my little girl down the aisle.
Sorry. Sorry. Surgery ran long, but I'm here.
I made it. Where do you want me?
That is not where you will be.
Oh, this is your spot? Sorry.
Hey, Mark.
Why don't you stand over here next to me?
At least one of my fathers-in-law doesn't hate me.
You're Sofia's father.
I love Sofia, so I'm gonna at least try to like you.
But if you call me your father-in-law again, I'll knock you out.
Okay.
So Arizona walks down the aisle first.
There she goes.
All right. And then I go.
Mm.
Okay.
And then I hand the bouquet to ... Mom ... can I hand you the bouquet?
Actually, I, um, I-I need to use the powder room.
Excuse me.
Well, I'd like some bouquet time if you don't mind.
I haven't had enough bouquet time today.
I mean, you'd think being on the chief's research project would help in the race for chief resident.
You might even think it'd make me a contender.
Only I'm not saving little kids or people with Alzheimer's.
I'm cleaning up mouse poop.
Can you hand me that basin?
Wanna hear my conversation with the chief every morning?
"- Avery, how are the mice?
Oh, they're fine, chief."
"They're running on their wheels. They're eating their cheese."
If I worked at a pet store, I'd be employee of the month by now.
But I'm a surgeon, babysitting a bunch of mice.
Until you get F. D. A. approval, okay, which, I'm sure you're gonna be working on humans any day now.
Now grab me another plum.
Why are you peeling these things apart anyway?
I'm practicing.
Since my kid's skin has grown directly onto the heart muscle, I'm gonna be helping Teddy remove the adhesions without puncturing the heart.
Hey! Don't eat my adhesions.
Oh, gross.
Okay, okay, look, I need 20 good reasons why I shouldn't let Cristina back on my service today, because I am ready to buckle.
I have got a really complicated case, and I could use her skills today, so 20 reasons, right now, please.
I don't have one reason.
Ugh.
I think you should put her back on your service.
No. No.
That would be the worst thing that I could do.
I mean, that j ... that won't teach her a thing.
She went over your head in a surgery.
Yes, that was bad form, but don't you think you're being a little bit harsh?
Harsh? Okay, first of all, she went over my head to you, and you enabled that behavior, which you really shouldn't have done.
But more importantly is, Cristina is dangerous right now.
She got lucky. Callie survived that procedure, but it just as easily could've been disastrous.
Cristina got lucky. She doesn't see it that way.
She thinks she's right. She always thinks she's right.
And that is not being a good doctor.
That is dangerous.
Tell her that.
Instead of just shutting her out, tell her that.
There's no telling Cristina Yang anything.
She has to learn it.
And until then, I am okay being the bad guy.
I can handle her being angry at me.
Do you really think that she can handle something like killing Callie Torres?
So Zola doesn't have a Chiari malformation, but she does have hydrocephalus.
Okay.
Let's book an O.R. for the shunt right away, okay?
Hey, what do you got for me? Any news?
Ugh. I went over all the screening tests, but you need to start looking at the next wave of patient charts.
Next wave?
The Alzheimer's trial. The first wave of the trial is done.
Now we're getting ready to treat the next group.
Let me know when the O.R. is booked.
Mer, what's going on? Does he know what you did?
What did I do?
I saw you with the clinical trial envelope.
You were hiding it under your lab coat.
Look, if you messed with this trial somehow, this could be bad for you ... like, really bad.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whatever you did, no matter how minor, it invalidates the entire project.
Alex ... You could get into real trouble here, Mer.
It's illegal to mess around with a blind trial.
I didn't do anything! So shut up about it.
Dr. Stark, can I talk to you?
Well, it appears you already are.
I-I have some concerns about Asha.
She hasn't eaten a bite of food since she arrived.
All right. Start her on parenteral nutrition.
I will, obviously, but more to the point, the fact that she's not eating, not speaking ... Kepner.
She just seems really scared, and I ... You know, unless the next piece of information from your mouth relies on the words, uh,"Lab results"
or "Vitals" or "Code blue," I don't care.
You promised.
You promised me that we could work together, that-that it wouldn't be weird, that-that you would treat me like any other resident.
I assure you, I am treating you exactly the way I treat other residents.
It's a 9-1-1 on Asha.
Asha, what's wrong?
Okay, what happened?
Her blood pressure dropped out.
Her pulse was thready.
Somebody notify Hunt.
Help.
Okay, get me four units of packed cells ... draw a new C. B. C. , coags, open up her fluids.
Kepner, get a gown.
I'm fine.
I-I need a central line kit right now.
Kepner.
I'm fine. I've got this.
Two more days.
Mm-hmm.
We can handle two more days.
And then they'll be gone, and our lives will go back to normal.
No more brunches. No more praying.
No more of my dad calling himself
The colonel.
We just need to focus on the big picture ... Yeah.
Which is ... you and I
are getting married.
We're getting married.
We're getting married.
We couldn't stop the bleeding, so we rushed her here.
Oh, what the hell?
It-it looks like wax.
I have never seen anything like this.
Nobody has, at least not in the States.
She has intestinal T. B. Poor kid.
There's adhesions everywhere.
It's hard to even know where to begin.
The perforation's pretty high at the lesser curvature.
We should treat it like a normal perf, right?
And then start the anti-T. B. meds?
The-the less aggressive we are, the greater chance we can avoid short gut syndrome.
Absolutely right, Kepner.
Let's start by ligating the bleeding vessel.
The trick is to go in very slowly until you feel a little give, and then you should see some fluid.
Got it.
Very nice.
You know, I wasn't exactly pleased when you decided to bow out of the trial.
Yeah, well ... But the work you're doing with the kids is really impressive.
Thank you.
And you were right about Meredith being the right person for the Alzheimer's trial all along.
I'm impressed. You are remarkably calm for a bride who's getting married tomorrow.
Well, you should see the schedule that my dad put together.
I just show up where I belong, when I belong.
It's perfect. Everyone should get married like this.
Who is that from, hottie husband or hottie boyfriend?
It's from Andrew, who is not my boyfriend.
He's just, uh, he's just my wedding date.
Uh-huh, and does your hottie wedding date know about your hottie husband?
Well, there's nothing to know.
I mean, Andrew will be in town for another week, and then he's off to who knows where.
So I'm just enjoying what he has to offer while he's offering.
Appropriate urinary output, normal weight reading, and ... running on the wheel.
Patient H. , you're looking great.
Very good.
Patient I. , what can I say?
Appropriate urinary output.
I cannot believe I am talking to mice like they're ... Oh, no.
No, no, no. Mouse J.
Mouse J.
Okay, so just pretend my hoodie's a gown.
Okay?
And ... open your eyes.
What do you think?
I had it made to look like yours.
I-I can see that.
I have loved this picture since I was a little girl, and I just wanted to surprise you.
I ... It's ... do you like it?
Okay, what, mom?
What don't you like?
Well, n-nothing, nothing. It's ... It's lovely.
Lovely.
That's ... it?
What else would you like me to say?
Oh, I don't know. Something.
I mean, I've been bending over backwards since you first got here just to make you feel comfortable.
I didn't ask you to do anything for me.
I'm getting married in a church for you.
Don't you dare imply that there's anything about a wedding to a woman or ... a baby out of wedlock that's for me.
Wow.
Okay.
So what bothers you more, my b*st*rd child or my lesbian fiancée?
You're a lawyer, mom.
You're out in the world. You know other gay people.
Your secretary's gay.
I'm your daughter.
Do you know how devastating it is to raise a child and to love a child and know you won't see that child in heaven?
Oh, mom.
You are not a bride.
And I am not the mother of a bride.
And this ... th-this-this isn't your wedding.
It isn't right.
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
I just can't.
Sefu ... didn't they get you a cot so you could stay with your brother tonight?
I can't sleep.
Back home ... I have all of these sisters, but Kondo ... he's my only brother.
And ... I don't want to lose him.
I know you don't.
I know.
You've apparently stopped answering your pages in order to, what, join the kitchen staff?
I need those post-op reports.
Wet-to-dry dressing applied in 18-10.
Vitals stable in your Crohn's patient, post-op.
You were exposed to H. I. V. positive blood.
I suppose you've checked yourself for cuts.
I'm a doctor. We get exposed to things all the time.
I know proper protocol.
And the sticky yellow mess here, this took priority over reporting back to me because ... This sticky yellow mess is nsima.
It's a maize porridge, which happens to be a staple in most east-African countries.
I found the recipe online.
I'm not sure why Asha hasn't eaten in two days, but I am sure that she's not used to eating processed American food.
I don't expect you to care, but when she is ready to eat after surgery, she's gonna be hungry, and she's used to corn porridge.
So while I can't make her talk, I can't do anything about the fact that she is sick, that she has advanced T. B. , that she is a 10 year old living with A. I. D. S. , I can do this.
I can make my patient something she might eat.
So unless you have more insults for me, Dr. Stark, I'm a little busy now making porridge.
I-I tried to reason with her.
She won't listen.
She's just sitting downstairs in the car.
I don't ... I don't know what to say, sweetheart.
I'm-I'm so sorry.
Daddy, you need to go. Okay?
Go? I-I can't ... I'm not leaving ... You have to go, okay, because if you don't, I will start crying, and then that will make you feel bad, and then I will feel worse, so you ... have to go.
Okay?
Okay.
Is there any milk over there?
Alex, is there any more milk?
So you're not talking to me now, is that it?
You told me to shut up, so I'm just gonna sit here and read the cereal box and practice keeping my mouth shut.
I didn't change any data or falsify any results.
Or switch a syringe so some sweet, sad old lady would get the drug and not the placebo?
That's what I thought.
Nothing I did will change any results.
It doesn't change the potential effectiveness of the drug.
It doesn't change anything.
Except the life of the guy who was supposed to get the drug and now won't.
Look, the truth will come out, when the F. D. A. investigates, they'll invalidate Seattle Grace as a research institution.
That blacklists you, Derek, every fricking doctor in this hospital.
This is bigger than you.
It messes with me. It messes with everyone.
I mean, I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a liar.
I never thought you were either.
So what are you saying, you're gonna tell?
Morning.
I'm late for work.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, good. Can I borrow something?
It can be anything, really ... a handkerchief, tissue, cash.
I've got something old, new, blue.
I just need something borrowed.
I just got a call from father Brooks.
Mm-hmm.
His wife got into an accident.
Oh.
She's okay, but, uh, they're in the E. R. now.
He's not gonna make it to the wedding.
You're kidding.
Please tell me you're kidding.
Do you know how hard it was to find a minister willing to marry us?
Well, he left me some numbers. We can call for a replacement ... No, no, no. You know what? Don't make any calls.
Don't get anyone. Just ... forget it.
I'm not getting married.
Let's go.
Mouse J. here took a turn for the worse last night.
I did an X-ray.
It didn't show anything, so I did a C.T.
You did an X-ray and a C.T. on a mouse?
I mean, if there's anything in this C.T. , I can't make it out.
I couldn't either, which is why I did an M.R.I.
You did a C.T. and an M.R.I. ?
Avery, you have $8, 000
worth of scans right here for a rodent.
Yes, sir, I understand that, but if you just look at the M.R.I. Just look.
What do you see?
I see a-a little hernia.
And the portal vein's not draining very well.
Which means the problem isn't the way the device functions.
It's where the device functions.
We just need to put it closer to the surface, just underneath the skin. Let's get started.
Hey. Hi. You paged?
Yeah. Zola, this is Meredith.
Meredith, this is Zola.
Here, can you hold her for a minute?
Uh, sure.
Come here.
There. Okay.
Zola, can you smile for me?
Yeah. See? Her facial movements are intact.
Okay, look. Over here. See that?
Watch how she's tracking me. Over here.
Neuro exam is good, even after the shunt.
Great. Did something happen? Why did you page?
I need to ask you something, okay? Okay.
Can you excuse us for a minute?
Yes, doctor.
I need you to be completely honest with me. Okay?
If Alex said something to you ... Let's adopt this baby.
What? Are you serious?
Yeah.
You know, I was holding her yesterday, and she was crying, and then she stopped.
And I've-I've held a lot of babies.
I've fixed a lot of babies, but I looked down at Zola ... I don't know what it was. I just ... I just couldn't imagine her being with any other parent or any other family.
We've been trying so hard to start a family, and-and she needs one.
Let's adopt her. I'm serious.
Let's adopt her.
You realize your door is unlocked?
I could be anyone.
I could be ... a burglar coming to burgle you.
Where is the baby?
Oh.
I could be a baby-napper trying to baby-nap you.
I know why they sent you.
And it doesn't matter what you say. The wedding's still off.
Mm.
My mom's right. It's a joke.
It's not a wedding and it's not happening.
Oh, Callie.
I can't have a priest.
I no longer have a minister.
I'm not being given away by my dad.
The wedding isn't legal. What's the point?
This isn't a wedding. It's not even in a church.
It's nothing. It's a couple of girls playing dress up.
It's not real.
It's not real.
J ... Okay.
First of all, you do not need the law or a priest or your mother to make your wedding real.
And-and the church is ... the church can be anywhere you want it to be ... I-in a field ... on a mountain, right here in this room, anywhere ... because where do you think god is?
Come on. He's in you.
He's in me.
Just right here, in the middle of us.
Now your-your church just hasn't caught up to god yet.
Your mother ... she hasn't caught up to god yet.
And by the way ... she may not ever catch up, but it's okay.
Mm.
It's okay.
If you are willing to stand up in front of your friends and family and god and commit yourself ... to another human being, to-to give of yourself in that kind of partnership, for better or worse, in sickness and health, honey, that is a marriage.
That is real.
And that's all that matters.
Besides ... Girl, I got legally married to a man in a church.
Look how well that turned out.
You ready for me yet?
Just about.
Okay, Grey, time to repair the V. S. D.
through the diverticulum.
Can I have a little suction here, please?
Thank you.
Uh-huh. All right, there's a small defect at the neck of the diverticulum.
Grey, pull up on your pickups so I can get in there.
Hold the graft.
Are you gonna use an 11-blade to make the incision?
No, she's going in blind.
5-0 suture.
All right. I'm sewing in the graft.
Grey, would you like to tie off when I finish?
Y-yes. Yes.
We addressed all the strictures and adhesions without sacrificing much of the intestines at all.
Hell of a save.
So, Dr. Hunt, I understand you've been put in charge of determining the next chief resident.
With input from all of the attendings obviously.
All right. Well, in that case, I'd like to talk to you about April Kepner.
I think if you check my file, you'll see that I rarely give formal feedback about my residents.
When I do, it is almost exclusively negative.
That said, I'd very much like to recommend April Kepner for the chief resident position.
She goes above and beyond for her patients even when she isn't asked.
Well, especially when she isn't asked.
She sees the patient as a whole, not just as a set of symptoms.
I'll tell you, that kind of caring, that can't be taught.
So I think this hospital would be lucky to have her as the next chief resident.
Hmm. Well, thank you, Dr. Stark.
Yeah.
That's very good to hear.
Are you sure he's still breathing?
I'm sure, yeah.
I couldn't have done this without you today, Avery.
Any of this.
I really appreciate your dedication to these mice and this project ... Whisker twitched.
His whisker twitched!
O-okay, okay.
Come on. Come on.
All right.
Come on. Come on, yeah.
We did it! He's back!
Mouse J. is back, baby!
Uh, yeah. Excellent work.
Keep this up, you may be getting your own slow clap.
Robbins, babysitter's here. Sofia's asleep.
I look great, by the way. Let's go.
Robbins, you okay?
When I came out to my brother, he asked me if that meant that I was gonna marry a chick.
And when I said yes, he got this b-big smile, and he said,"I'm gonna dance so hard at your wedding."
My dreams are coming true ... Dreams I didn't even know that I had ... but my brother's not here.
He's missing it.
And I know that I'm late. I know it. I know it.
But why do you think that my dad schedules every minute of every day?
If every minute is accounted for, then there's no time to slow down and just ... I just ... I need a minute to miss my brother.
Look at this list ... blood work, financial statements, a home study, I mean, fire alarms.
And this is all just to see if the U. S. C. I. S. thinks that we're suitable to adopt.
Look, if you don't want to do this ... No, I do. She could be our little girl.
She will be.
Look, don't get overwhelmed, okay?
We're gonna take this list one step at a time, one day at a time, okay?
In fact, look, I can see something we could cross off today.
Look. Right here.
I told you, I don't want to do that.
Well, it's for the baby.
Okay, you ready?
I am.
Okay, then. Let's get married.
It's my own damn fault.
Had I minded my own business, the wedding would be canceled, and I'd be home looking at TV by now.
You're gonna be fine.
You're doing great. Come on.
Whew. Okay.
Okay. Right here. All right.
Okay.
You can let go of my hand now.
All right.
Hi.
All right.
Don't trip. Don't trip. Don't ... You're not gonna trip.
You're right. I won't.
Okay.
Um, who gives this bride to this bride?
That'd be me.
Applicants Grey and Shepherd.
That'd be us.
There you go.
Need to see some I. D.
Here it is. Sure.
Okay, this seems to be in order.
I'll jump right in.
Uh, we are here today to participate in a marital union ... To celebrate, uh, love and happiness and loyalty, and well, in my opinion, a little bit of magic ... Acting in conformity to the laws and regulations of the state of Washington ... To bring together two exceptional and beautiful human beings.
Since it is your intention to enter into marriage, join hands and repeat after me, I, uh, Derek Shepherd ... I, Derek Shepherd ... I take you, Calliope Torres, to be my wife ... For better or for worse, in good times and bad ... I choose you to be the one with whom I spend my life.
Do you have some token you wish to exchange?
No.
No, we didn't have time to get rings.
Okay, we'll skip that part.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, you sign there, and you sign there.
By these acts and according to the laws of the state of Washington ... Okay, I hereby pronounce you wife and wife.
Congratulations.
Well, thank you.
Next applicants, please.
First dance.
So what happened with Teddy? Did you talk to her?
So my date just called to say she got stuck delivering a baby.
Literally ... the baby got stuck halfway out.
I was wrong to doubt the mice. Karev, watch your back, 'cause mouse J. has just made me a contender.
Thank you, mouse J.
To mouse J.
You're not the only contenders, you know?
My sources tell me that Kepner could be a dark horse.
Oh, please.
No offense, Dr. Hunt, but, uh, I have you scheduled for a Swenson procedure on a 2-year-old orphan tomorrow morning.
I'm sure you understand. I'm just looking out for the kids that I brought here from Africa.
Any idea when they're cutting the cake?
I wanted to take a piece to Adele.
Oh, I have no idea, sir.
You know, it's funny how things work out.
Karev stepped up.
Jackson's starting to shine. There's Kepner, Grey.
I always assumed that you would be the front-runner for chief resident, Yang.
But, uh, it just goes to show ... you can't count anyone out.
I'm gonna check on that cake.
You want a real apology?
Can't this wait till work tomorrow?
'Cause my date's waiting for me.
You know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm such an exceptional surgeon that it threatens you. I'm sorry my surgical repair saved Callie's life and yours didn't.
I'm sorry your ego is so fragile that I had to stand on the sidelines of a surgery
I should have been performing with you today, like I have been standing on the sidelines for the past three months, basically ruining my chances for chief resident.
You want sincerity? I could not be more sincere.
And yet ... you still don't get it.
Hi.
Hi.
My glass is empty again.
I, uh, I have a proposition for you.
Mm. I like the sound of that.
I've been offered a position at Landstuhl medical center.
In Germany? Wow.
Uh, wow. That's, uh ... That's an amazing facility.
The position they offered me is permanent.
So I accepted on one condition.
That they find an opening for my incredibly talented cardiothoracic surgeon girlfriend.
Andrew ... I live a nomadic life.
And it's never bothered me till now.
I want to settle down.
I want to start a life with someone, and I'm hoping that that someone is you.
Just when we think we've figured things out ...
the universe throws us a curveball.
All right, it's now time to clear the dance floor and make way for the father-daughter dance, folks.
Oh, crap. I forgot to take that off the schedule.
I-I meant to. I'm sorry. It can ... No, no, no, no, no.
Of course you should get to dance with your dad. It's okay.
I'll just sit this one out.
Okay.
Go ahead.
No, you won't. I'm a father.
I can dance. Let's dance.
Oh.
So we have to improvise.
We really need to leave if we're even gonna make an appearance.
Oh, come on. Just one more minute.
You said that 20 minutes ago.
Listen to her. Listen to her. Look at her.
Come on. Listen to that.
We're not gonna make the wedding, are we?
They'll understand.
We'll get 'em a really nice present.
Right? Look at you. Come on. Look at her.
Look at her.
We find happiness in unexpected places.
May I cut in?
She's all yours.
We find our way back
to the things that matter the most.
I was driving to the airport with your mother, and it hit me ... I've been looking forward to dancing with you on your wedding day since I first held you in my arms, so I turned the car around and came back.
So here I am to have this dance with my daughter.
The universe is funny that way.
Sometimes it just has a way
of making sure we wind up exactly where we belong.
F.D. » Transcripts » G » Grey's AnatomyWe've all heard the same.
It's one of those things we've learned in seventh grade science class.
Adapt or die.
I ... don't understand.
It's two words: No s*x.
I'm sure there should be more words.
If you're gonna choose chief resident, you have to be impartial.
Come on. This? Now?
s*x with me, however hot and excellent, could cloud your judgment.
This is blackmail is it what it is.
No, it is not. Final interviews are today, and coincidentally, I am on your service.
Coincidentally. - Well, since Teddy's shutting me out of cardio, where I can show my stuff, I'm gonna show it to you.
So today you'll see me not as your naked and desirable wife ... Mm.
But as a focused, organized, efficient, and deserving candidate who's getting in the shower.
No. I'll come with you.
No. No, no. No clouding.
Owen, this hurts me more than it hurts you.
No, it doesn't.
I know.
Adapting isn't easy, though.
You have to fight your competition, fend off their attacks, and sometimes, you have to kill.
Good morning.
You're meeting with Owen this morning, right?
Yeah.
You're not gonna say anything about me or the trial, right?
You know, I thought you were gonna say something like "good luck,"
but I guess it's every freakin' man for himself, huh?
You do what you need to do to survive.
But tell him that you were instrumental in getting the chief's trial approved for phase 1 human testing ... from mice to humans.
I'm not doing that.
Well, okay, I know, you don't like bragging about yourself, but you don't even have to brag.
I mean, your diabetes trial does it for you.
It's gonna win every award. Seriously.
Just make sure that he knows that you ... - I got it.
That you have been instrumental ... Got it.
He don't got it.
I got it.
I got the job at Baylor.
Over 50 applicants, I ... I got it.
That's awesome.
Well, um, I don't know. I mean ... it's in Texas.
There are a lot of factors to consider, right?
Yeah, but it's what you wanted. It's, uh, it's a great program.
Well, I-I mean, I was thinking of sticking around here for another year ... - Crap. Oh, I gotta go.
I gotta prep for my meeting with Hunt.
Besides, if I'm here when you win chief resident, you'll still have a friend.
Look, we all get it's not personal.
I mean, it's a ... it's a competition.
Sometimes, you gotta be a shark.
Congratulations on Baylor.
Huh? You see?
Sorry I'm late. I was cramming.
What, for Hunt?
No.
You got that in the bag.
No, I'm more worried about the interview with the social worker.
Don't laugh at me, Derek.
Nothing in my life has prepared me for this.
My mother was about as nurturing as a steak knife. - I know. I know.
I don't know anything about making lunches or Halloween costumes.
Good moms make Halloween costumes.
Well, you can sew.
I sew skin.
Yeah. See? It's gonna be fine.
It's just instinct, right?
Here you go. There you go. Oh, there you go.
Okay. Okay. Oh.
She looks good. Her weight's up, and, uh, her previous incisions have healed.
The labs are within normal limits ... And she's super-duper cute, aren't you?
Okay. So it's an uncomplicated hernia.
So you don't have to use any artificial closures, right?
Yeah, no. No, it's really simple.
Good.
I'll do a short incision in her suprapubic crease to do a traditional exposure, and then I'll ... Finish with a ... Chupo.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
That's ... that's what Callie calls a pacifier.
But Zola hasn't eaten because of the surgery.
She's probably hungry. Um, you might want to try to soothe her with the pacifier.
Come here, baby. Come here, little baby.
Chupo. Oh, yes. There you go. Ooh.
Chupo.
Wow.
All right. I'll call you when I'm ready to come take her up.
See? We'll figure it out.
Are you excited?
It's been a month, Abena. You ready to go home?
I snagged some extra hydroxyurea.
Wait, wait, wait.
You forgot something.
You need to take that at home, okay?
Along with your antibiotics.
It's gonna help with the sickle cell symptoms, and the attacks will be less severe when they happen. - Thank you.
I'll make sure she takes it.
Now you have sickle cell, Lebo, so you need to make sure you take some, too.
Yes, ma'am.
Promise me?
Yes, Dr. Alex.
Oh. And don't forget ... you both have to have your blood counts monitored at the clinic, even if you feel fine.
I will, just as you told me. I promise.
Thank you. Thank you for helping my sister.
Thank you so much.
Oh.
Are you in pain, Lebo?
No, no, I am fine. We have to go.
Dr. Bailey.
Well, maybe we should check you out.
She'll miss the plane. It's no trouble.
I'm fine.
Okay. Wait, hold ... Aah! Aah!
Gurney!
Oh. Okay, okay, okay.
How about her?
She's smiling. Who smiles when they go for a run?
Happy people.
Happiness is overrated. What about you?
Shouldn't what's his name be off to save the world pretty soon?
What's his name is taking a break from world saving.
He was offered a permanent position at Landstuhl, so ... On your left.
Oh, watch out.
It's a U. S. military hospital in Germany, and he leaves in a week.
That's great.
He asked me to go with him.
Wow.
You okay?
Uh, yeah.
I mean, I-I really ... I like him.
I-I feel like things could be good with us.
That's just crazy, right?
I mean, besides, I have too many obligations here.
I'm in the middle of my contract, I-I have residents to teach, I have you.
Okay. You just listed me as an obligation.
No. That ... that's not what I meant. I mean, no, you're not ... No, I get it. Like I'm dead weight.
I'm an anchor, dragging you down. I'm horrible.
No, stop. That's ... no. I-I ... If I move, it might cause your insurance headaches.
I'm just saying that we would sort of ... We would just have to sort it out.
Okay.
Okay.
What about her?
Yeah, if a unibrow was my thing, I'd be all over that.
You're hopeless.
What do you got?
17-year-old pregnant female with syncopal
Episode outside the E. R.
Look, she's got blood in her left lower quadrant.
Could be a splenic rupture, but it's hard to tell. - Abena ... Abena's fine. Don't worry about her right now.
You need to worry about yourself.
You need to have surgery.
Lebo, why didn't you tell us you were pregnant?
You would've said I cannot fly. I had to be here for my sister.
Is something wrong with my baby?
I see a strong heartbeat, but there's not much fluid surrounding the baby, and he's very small for 32 weeks.
She's eight months along?
Yeah, I'm gonna need to monitor this baby.
Well, we need to take her to C.T. first to see where the abdominal bleeding's coming from.
Okay, I'll meet you in surgery.
She's barely breathing. I'll get an ambu.
I've got blood hanging, but her B. P. 's still dropping.
No time for a C.T.
All right, call up and get an O.R. ready.
It's based on a protocol used in aviation. - Mm-hmm.
A simple checklist has led to a huge drop in plane crashes.
'Cause it cuts down on human error.
Exactly, and I thought instead of ... Here you go.
Thanks ... telling you about it in an interview, I'd walk you through it.
Mm-hmm.
So the checklist is the first page on every patient clipboard so you can see at a glance that Mr. Aranda has been checked in for coughing up blood, has been seen by a physician, has had a chest X-ray, and those results have come back, so now we just need to get a consent for bronchoscopy to rule out cancer.
Cancer? He might have cancer?
Like grandpa had?
He died. - Whoa, whoa. What are you talking about?
I'm sorry. I-I said "rule out cancer."
There's a spot on your X-ray that we just need to take a closer look at so that we can be sure that your dad's just fine.
Just to be sure, okay?
Okay. So that's, uh ... update the patient.
Dr. Hunt, bed seven is admitted for observation, bed five is discharged, I put in a drain in bed nine, and I'm reporting for further instruction.
You are organized.
And focused and efficient.
Okay. Well, Mr. Aranda here needs to go up to bronchoscopy.
Well, I'll take him.
Oh, actually, no.
Proper protocol is to page Dr. Altman.
She will schedule the bronchoscopy.
See? It's right here on the checklist.
Protocol. Okay, so the next step is the O.R. checklist.
Mr. Aranda, let's get you up to bronchoscopy.
Oh, there's a lot of bleeding here.
Uh, more suction.
Where's the source?
Well, so far the spleen looks good.
Just keep exploring.
Uh, just a little more retraction there, please.
Whoa.
Uh ... What's he doing there?
Nobody move. Gown me. I'm going in.
Um, how did her baby get tangled up in her intestines?
Right over here.
The baby survived a full term outside of the uterus?
Yeah, it's extremely rare.
Her tubes are scarred, so the fertilized egg found a place to implant where it could continue to grow.
Dr. Bailey, grab his foot while I free him from these adhesions.
Well, why didn't it show up on the ultrasound?
Believe it or not, it's missed about 50% of the time.
Keep suctioning. Okay, he's coming out.
Clamps to Dr. Robbins, please. Dr. Karev, cut the cord and take him to get checked out.
Okay, the blood in her abdomen is from her placenta ripping apart.
We need to remove as much as possible.
Be prepared for torrential hemorrhage. Check the ... Pressure's dropping.
Damn it. Clamps. Zero vicryl.
We gotta stop this bleeding, or we're gonna lose her.
Crossmatch six more units of R. B. C. S and get them up here, stat. Alex, I don't hear that baby.
Come on, buddy. Give it up.
And I've been doing some research on diabetes, and I heard you're starting a clinical trial.
I-I'd like to see if I could get on it.
Well, the trial has very specific criteria.
I mean, the subjects have to remain impartial.
The fact that you're married to one of my attendings ... Look, I know that you have never been wild about the fact that Teddy married me, but the truth is, I really like her ... And not just for her insurance.
But she still sees me as a patient, as a ... as an insurance sponge.
I need to get my own insurance, so in order to do that I need a job, and in ord to get a job, it would be helpful if I wasn't going into diabetic shock every five minutes.
Hey, um, what's this?
Just a ... Oh.
Hey. Hunt. Uh, my knee replacement got canceled, and I need to break some bones.
Aren't you supposed to mend them?
Well, it's my first day back, and I left my baby for the first time since we got home.
I need to remember why I
love being a surgeon so much or I'm afraid I will walk out of here and never come back.
It doesn't have to be big.
Just a sprained ankle, hairline fracture, anything.
Okay. - Oh, my God. Anytime I hear a baby cry, it makes me think of Sofia.
They all sound like her. Wait. That really sounds like her.
What? What are you doing here?
It's bring your daughter to work day.
No, it's not.
I bathed her, changed her. I fed her, I napped her.
Hi.
We read a book, played with that little hanging, jingling thing ... And it was still only 11:30. I needed some adult contact.
Please take this baby away from me.
Sure.
I'm serious. Take her, Mark.
Okay.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This baby's crack.
She's a crack baby.
You shouldn't call her that.
Torres. You're in luck. Motorcycle crash 20 minutes out.
Yes. Okay.
Oh, I love you, but mommy's gotta go to work.
Take her, Mark.
Give me the baby.
Just physically lift her from my arms.
Oh, no. - No, no. It's not that bad.
Okay. I'll be right ... Back ... back you go.
Okay.
Lebo's bowel looks clean.
We got all the adhesions.
How's the baby?
Good. Apgar score's 9 and 10.
How's she doing?
We got the bleeding under control and removed the placenta, and we're about to close.
She's gonna be just fine.
Yeah, for now.
She's gonna go back there.
She won't get the follow-up care that she needs.
Once she and her sister run out of the sickle cell meds we gave them, then what are they gonna do?
The best they can.
What about the kid? He's probably a sickler, too.
Who's gonna give him his vaccination?
Well, how about you, Karev?
What?
You.
Go there. Go back with them.
The job at Namboze clinic has never been filled.
They're looking for someone who's single, unattached, with minimum three years residency.
There's a med school loan forgiveness grant attached to it.
They've already been coordinating with you.
I mean, they know you. You're kind of perfect.
Well, that's pretty far to go for a follow-up exam.
You'd be great. I could take care of it with one call.
So you just think about it.
Sir.
Oh, Avery. Uh, that chart over there ... Henry Burton ... needs to be screened.
If he meets the criteria, put him in line for phase 1.
Chief, I, um, I'm sorry.
I need to step away from the trial.
You what?
I appreciate the opportunity, I do, and I don't want to inconvenience you going forward ... I'm not worried about me.
You were a big part of getting this thing where it is.
I don't know why you want to give it up.
Well, that's very nice of you to say, sir.
But I feel like I need to focus on surgery right now.
You sure about this?
Respectfully, yes.
I am.
Thank you, sir.
Excellent work, Dr. Karev.
Grey, just give me two seconds.
Okay.
No, I didn't say anything.
But maybe you should if you're so worried about it, before somebody finds out.
No one is going to.
Grey. Ready?
Yeah.
Okay, there it is.
It doesn't look like a tumor.
It looks like ... Wait. What is that?
I'm gonna come at it from a different angle.
There. That's better.
I just need to get a little closer.
Oh, my God.
Wait. Is that ... Is that a ... is it?
Yes.
Should we call Dr. Altman?
No.
No.
Merry Christmas. You don't have a tumor.
You have a tree growing in your lung.
My husband has a what?
A-a tree.
You could have, uh, inhaled a seedling and somehow, it took root and started growing in there.
We were, um, trimming our trees a couple of months ago, and ... and stuff was flying around, but ... but ... but how can it grow?
There's ... there's no light, there's no soil.
I-it happens. Somehow, it just adapted.
So my dad doesn't have cancer?
No, he doesn't. Uh, but he'll need a little surgery, and then he'll be fine.
Dr. Yang, can I please see you in the hall?
My dad doesn't have cancer.
That's great.
Um, to be clear, I never said he had cancer.
You were wrong. You're a bad doctor.
Shh. Hey. Come on.
Dr. Yang, one minute, please.
I'll be back.
You falsified his checklist.
I streamlined it, and I
found a tree in his lung.
You never paged Dr. Altman. You just hijacked this patient.
A tree, April. A conifer.
That's ... Well, that's ... mm-hmm.
Well, did ... did you ... did you tell Dr. Altman?
No. I found it. He's my patient.
And I'm gonna take it out myself. You're what?
It's a biopsy ... like a glorified lung biopsy.
Otherwise known as a thorocotomy, which is a procedure that needs to be supervised by an attending ... one little breach in protocol won't ... oh! So you do admit it was a breach of protocol?
April, if you do this with me, I will put in a good word for you with Owen.
Why would you do that?
'Cause it's a tree in a man's lung.
Got your C.T. And blood work, reviewed your files.
Yes, and?
And it looks like medically, you're a candidate.
But, uh, I still have some reservations.
Oh, Dr. Webber.
Andrew Perkins. Well, this is a surprise.
Hope you're not here on business.
Uh, actually, I have a lunch date with Dr. Altman.
Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Uh, Andrew, this is my ... my friend, uh, who I told you about.
Oh, the v. H. L. Guy with, uh, diabetes?
Among other things, yes.
H-Henry Burton. Uh, sorry. I didn't mean ... no, it's fine. I am ... I'm Teddy's friend, the v. H. L. Guy with diabetes.
But hopefully, not for long.
Henry's gonna be on my clinical trial.
That's ... that's great. You didn't tell me that.
Well, I don't like to brag, so ... So should we get to lunch?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Um, congratulations.
Thanks.
I'm in? What about your reservations?
You're going against Andrew Perkins.
Let's just say, uh, I have a thing for the underdog.
He is a handsome man.
He's also one of the world's foremost trauma counselors.
If there's an earthquake, a plane crash, any kind of catastrophe ... he swoops in to help.
So you're saying, he's a professional knight in shining armor.
I'm saying you need all the help you can get.
Thanks.
How long of a commitment would you need?
Okay.
No, I-I understand.
Yeah, I-I just wanted a few days.
Yeah. I will.
You, too.
How's she doing?
Was that ... were you just talking to the namboze clinic?
Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to get, uh, some more specifics.
So you're gonna go. I don't know.
I mean, I'd get to do incredible surgeries right there in the trenches, plus, I'd be the boss.
I mean, after bringing all these kids over here, I can't imagine going back to just being a resident.
Being chief resident could be cool.
I mean, that would be a reason to stay, but I mean, who knows?
And if I don't get it, where does that leave me?
I'm left here with nothing.
What do you think?
Stay or go?
At this point, I really don't think it matters what I think.
Hey, what are you doing?
Getting ready to remove a tree from a guy's lung.
No time for mommy prep.
Okay, what if the social worker wants to ask me about the time I spent sleeping around Europe?
Oh, that's easy. You were absorbing other cultures.
Okay, and what about the fact that my mother had early-onset Alzheimer's and may have passed the gene on to me?
Makes you more appreciative of the gift of life.
Mm. Okay, I put my hand on a bomb in a body.
She could think that was ... Suicidal?
No. It was brave.
Uh, yeah, I told a shooter to shoot me.
Change the subject.
Chicks suck.
What's your problem?
Like you'd care.
I don't, but I've got four floors to kill in, and I'm on a hot streak.
Arizona offered me this job at her old clinic in Africa.
When I told Lucy I was thinking about it, she got all pissed and stormed off.
Well, did you ask her to come with you, tell her you'd miss her, look deeply into her eyes?
No.
Well, obviously, she's got feelings for you.
You're dead inside. You have no feelings.
By the way, you should take that job in Africa.
It'd be totally amazing.
You just want me out of the running for chief resident.
Just trying to help.
Ugh. Can I ask you a question?
Bring it.
Okay.
What is it about guy's with babies that makes women go crazy?
Doctor.
I mean, it's like when you're at the park ... - Thank you.
And you see a guy with a puppy. Now normally, you wouldn't even notice the guy, but then he's laughing, and the puppy's crawling all over him, and then he's ... he's tickling the puppy's little puppy belly, and then you're thinking, I wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life with that guy.
What is that?
Oh, everybody's looking at the baby, and no one's looking at Mark ... Except you.
Oh, Kepner.
Cristina.
Did you get the O.R. ?
I did. I ... Yes. Kepner, you know what?
I think I figured out something about you.
I have not had s*x for, like, three days, and I think it's giving me super powers.
Everything is bright and clear.
I am solving problems.
No wonder you are so organized. You have virgin super powers.
I-I don't think that that has anything to ... No, seriously. Thank you.
I-I've been shut out of cardio for months, and today is, like, the first day I felt like myself.
Thank you. I really needed this.
Oh, my God.
What?
You're just, like, treating me like a friend.
Yeah. So?
I'll go in and excise the tree with minimal invasion to your lungs.
Dr. Yang.
Join us, please.
Sorry. I needed this, too.
I don't understand.
Why isn't Dr. Yang doing the surgery?
Well, she's certainly capable, but Dr. Altman is our chief of cardio.
I have experience with complex cases like yours.
Okay, see, I saw three doctors for this cough before I came here today.
They all said the same thing, "it'll go away. Be patient."
And then I wake up this morning, and I'm coughing up blood.
And then this one over here tells me it's cancer.
Come on. That is not what I said.
Then finally ... I meet Dr. Yang here.
And she says it's not a cough and it's not cancer, but a tree in my lung ... And just like that, I'm not gonna die.
I'm gonna be fine.
So if she can do the surgery, I'd like to stick with her.
All right. Here is a scenario for you.
You are chief resident, and one of your colleagues comes to you and says that he is dropping out of a clinical trial.
What do you say?
Dr. Hunt ... What do you tell him?
I'd urge him to think it through carefully, but I would respect his decision.
Well, my opinion is that you have a history of quitting when things get tough, of walking away when you're challenged.
Now maybe it's because you're not used to working hard for things or maybe because you have a fear of success, but I am telling you, you're making a big mistake here.
I hear you.
I just disagree.
Anything else?
No.
Thank you.
You're actually considering this?
Look, just answer the question.
Can she perform the surgery?
Yes, she can.
She is capable.
In my defense, I was simply streamlining the process and took the initiative ... Cut the crap. You went behind my back to spite me.
Well, you gave me no choice.
Okay, look, enough.
You obviously have axes to grind, and I'm not gonna stand here while you sort it out.
In the meantime, this patient needs surgery.
He's more comfortable with Yang doing it.
She should be suspended for insubordination, but you're gonna reward her instead?
I'll decide disciplinary actions, Dr. Altman, and I will take them out on Dr. Yang, not on the patient.
You will observe.
Yes, sir.
Kepner, you'll assist.
Oh, sir, under the circumstances, don't you think that it would ... The ... the decision's been made.
And I'll make sure Dr. Hunt considers this in his evaluation for chief resident.
Let's get him prepped.
If it's a sliding hernia, she could ligate her ovary.
She's freeing the hernia sac to make sure that doesn't happen.
Is she preparing to do a Goldstein test?
Is she thinking about exploring the other side?
Arizona is just being thorough.
Don't worry, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
I wish you would stop saying that.
You don't know that.
Saying what?
"Everything's gonna be fine."
She's got a hernia, hydrocephalus, spina bifida.
Anything could happen.
Her bowel could rupture, her B. P. could drop out ... Robbins is not gonna let that happen.
She's gonna do ... - What if they find better parents for her?
Oh, come on. - What if they realize that we rushed into this without really knowing what we're doing ... Or that maybe a resident who works 80 hours a week isn't the best candidate for a mom?
So just please stop saying everything's gonna be okay, because you don't know that.
Okay.
Everything ... is gonna go ... the way it goes.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, please don't.
Oh.
This is the only place she'll fall asleep.
Turns out she's as bored with radiology as we are.
I'll get out of your way.
No, no, no. You stay.
Besides, I, uh, I haven't really seen her up close yet.
Wow.
She's so much bigger than the last time I saw her.
Eats like a champ.
Want to hold her?
W ... oh, no, no. No, it's okay.
Come on. Look at that face.
You know you want to.
No, it's o ... it's okay.
Yeah, I'll ... I'll just wake her, and then she'll cry, and then you'll hate me.
Besides, she, uh, doesn't look like she really wants to move.
Uh, I should go.
I, uh ... I am, uh, really happy for you.
You seem happy.
I am.
I have everything I always wanted.
Almost.
I have it. I have it.
Okay, can I get some more suction down here, please?
Look at that.
I can't believe it lived in there.
It managed to thrive in a hostile environment.
I'm gonna keep it.
What? No. No, no, it has to go to path and then get destroyed.
It's not cancer. It's a Christmas tree.
It's a pathology specimen.
Protocol ... - Protocol doesn't account for trees in people.
Protocol accounts for whatever comes up.
That's why we have protocol, so there are rules and steps that we can depend on.
I know the rules seem fussy and annoying and people hate them, and ... The people who enforce them are fussy and annoying, too, but they are there for a reason ... Fine!
Take it to path.
Thank you. I think you'll find ... It's not gonna be you, April.
I don't care how many boxes you check, you're not gonna be chief resident.
3-0 vicryl.
Here you go.
I, uh ... Gave Lebo platelets, and the baby is, uh, stable ... a little smushed, but stable.
It's hard to believe he spent the last eight months sleeping on a colon.
Nice work.
So you gonna do it ... Africa?
Honestly, I'm not sure.
It's a big decision to make in a day.
Are you in love with Lucy Fields?
Lucy and I, uh, it's new.
Why?
Because I don't want the person that I recommend to pull a me and go running back to the girl they left behind.
So just ... make sure you know what you're doing, or else you'll have me to answer to.
Hey.
Admit it ... you saw how good this baby looked on me, so you had to go get one of your own.
Everything's a competition with you.
How'd her surgery go?
Robbins said she's fine. She's feeding again.
Good, because Sofia can't wait to have a new friend.
Isn't that right, Sofia?
You and zola are gonna be best friends. Isn't that right?
Oh, you just wait.
This crap will be coming out of your mouth, too.
Well, let's hope so.
We're dealing with the international adoption treaties, and the waiver we need, they just don't ... Usually give those things out.
Well, you're ... both surgeons, you'd make good parents.
They're gonna see that.
We'd be naive get ahead of ourselves.
You're Derek Shepherd.
There's a reason I've been jealous of you my whole life, and it's not your hair.
You're gonna be okay. Even Sofia knows that.
Right, Sofia? Say hi ... Uncle Derek.
That's Zola's daddy. Yes, he is, right?
I'm gonna go feed her.
So I see here that your mother was a surgeon.
What was that like?
Uh, well, being raised by a surgeon, you definitely ... get to be very independent.
Um, and ... not that I would raise Zola the way that my mother raised me.
I, uh ... She ... didn't bake.
She wasn't a bake sale mom, and I ... plan on baking all the time.
How about you tell me about Zola?
Well, Zola had, uh, already had a shunt and spina bifida surgery, and then we realized she had this hernia.
And today in her surgery, it looked like she might go into S. V. T.
And just as the anesthesiologist was about to push the adenosine, it's like she knew to stop, and her heart just slowed down all by itself, and she went into sinus.
I-I'm sorry. That's not what you asked me, right?
I ... you want me to talk about how cute and sweet she is, and she is very cute and sweet, and I ... She ... I'm not doing very well, am I?
I don't have an agenda here, Dr. Grey.
I'm just trying to get a sense of who you are.
I'm a surgeon.
And, uh, I'm a good surgeon.
And I want to be a good mother.
Honestly, I don't know much about it.
But I am ready to learn, and I'm a fast learner.
And I will do whatever it takes to be a good mom.
You know what good moms do?
They brag about their babies, and that's what I heard today.
As it turns out, Zola's day didn't involve playgroup or baby gym class.
It involved surgery, and you knew where she was every second.
I appreciate you sharing that with me.
I was showing initiative.
That doesn't mean you get to pretend that you're an attending!
I wasn't pretending, I just didn't need an attending.
Oh, my God ... Teddy is doing a disservice to me and to the education that I deserve.
I had no choice but to take my learning into my own hands.
So I took the initiative and treated a patient and followed through to a successful outcome.
If that doesn't show the qualities of a chief resident, I don't know what does.
You're not gonna be the chief resident.
It's not gonna be you. I'm sorry.
Is this from the ... the chief or ... or from Teddy?
No, it's from me.
You r ... you know how important this is.
Chief resident can make your career.
You have your pick of fellowships.
You never had the qualifications.
Based on what?
Chief resident is more than just a resume boost.
It's managing schedules, overseeing interns, pushing papers, working within the system.
That isn't you. It's never been you.
You know, I'm ... I'm ... I'm protesting this.
You are screwing with my career.
And it will kill you.
You're a surgeon, and anything that keeps you from being a surgeon will hurt you and it will make you crazy.
We saw it today. You're not built for this job.
You will hate it and you will resent it you will fight against it until you fail.
So just ... just be a surgeon.
You know, it's ... it's what you are.
Just be excellent at what you are.
Are you done?
Yes.
Thank you for your time.
I'm not going to Africa.
Right. Uh, let me just say this ... No, it's the right thing. I-I can finish my residency, and then maybe we can both go to Africa.
Alex, I just ... just listen to me ... You were right this morning.
You said there were other factors to consider, and you are a factor.
I'm sorry I didn't say that sooner.
When Robbins said they were looking for someone single, I mean, that's how I think of myself because whenever I think of a future with someone, I always get kicked in the teeth, so I stopped even looking, but ... now with you ... Alex, stop.
Okay, just stop.
You were right this morning.
Career comes first. It's how it should be.
And so I ... I took the job.
So call 'em. Call Baylor.
At Namboze.
I took the job at Namboze clinic.
You what?
My job? You took my job?
Like you said, it's not personal.
Sometimes, you have to be a shark.
The job in Africa? The bitch stole it out from under me.
Who?
Lucy. I told her I'd stay.
You open yourself up to someone for one freakin' second ... Mm-hmm.
Calahan, I'll take a double whiskey.
I freakin' better get chief resident.
Here you go.
Scotch, please.
Here you go.
You know, the rules are there for a reason.
Oh, boy.
I killed a woman when I first started here.
I got fired for it ... Because I missed a little step ... one simple step.
We follow the protocols, we don't skip steps, people live ... simple as that.
You know, you're right.
I probably won't be chief resident, but the checklists work.
You can't tell me they don't.
Dropping out of the chief's trial is a real bonehead move, Avery.
Sir ... Such a bonehead move, that I started thinking, maybe the chief's trial is flawed.
So I looked into it myself.
The methodology is flawless.
In fact, it's the kind of stuff that, uh, wins awards ... big awards, like the Harper Avery.
You dropped out of the chief's trial
'cause you knew that if your name was on it, it would ruin the chief's chances.
I respect that you don't want to succeed on your name, but don't you ever let it hold you back.
There you are.
Hey. Everything okay?
Completely.
I wanted you to be the first to hear just how okay everything is.
I got my old job back.
You're kidding.
Mnh-mnh. I told 'em about Webber's trial and that I'm getting a new pancreas.
I've never used a pancreas as a selling point in a job interview before ... But it ... it did the trick, which means that I'm gonna have my own insurance in a couple of months.
That's really good news.
I'm glad you think so, because I've been ... I've been thinking about us and our situation and where we go from here, and I wanted to ask you ... - Teddy.
Uh, y-yeah. I-I will be right there, Andrew.
Lunch and dinner ... man's getting serious.
Well, dinner is to celebrate what we decided at lunch.
I'm going to Germany with him.
Uh, well, that's ... That's really good news, too.
It is.
Right?
Yeah.
Because like I said, I'm gonna be fine.
Which brings me back to the question that I wanted to ask you.
What's that?
May I please have a divorce?
Oh.
Yeah. I-I guess. Um ... Sure.
I mean ... You don't need me anymore, right?
Right.
I gotta go.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Adapt or die.
As many times as we've heard it, the lesson doesn't get easier.
Look who's here.
There you are.
I fed her, I changed her diaper.
Prettiest poop you ever saw.
Oh, really?
Hi, baby girl.
Oh, I missed you.
Yes, mommy got to be a surgeon again today.
I got to fix two dislocated shoulders and save a leg from amputation ... And a fractured ... yes.
Problem is ... We're human.
We want more than just to survive.
You staring at Sloan again?
Oh. The ... the baby. Did you see her?
How ... how did the interview go?
I'm out.
What? What happened?
It's a long story. It's fine.
Seriously. I'm okay with it.
I have you.
What else do I need?
We want love.
Hi.
Hi, Zola.
I'm Meredith.
I'm hoping to be your mama.
We want success.
You know it's gonna be Mer, right?
It doesn't mean that you're a bad surgeon or a bad doctor.
Some people just ... don't fit the bill.
They're better at other things ... Like you and those kids. I mean, you're good at that.
But between you and Mer ... She's organized, people like her, people trust her.
She's natural.
People trust her.
I'm just saying, go steal your job back.
I mean, go to Africa. That what you're good at.
Go do what you're good at.
We want to be the best that we can be.
Okay, I know you're mad, but you can't just sit here and drink all night, so I'm gonna take you home and ... I ... okay, I was not expecting that.
You told me to be excellent, so I'm gonna be.
I'm gonna be an excellent surgeon and I'm gonna be excellent in bed tonight.
So we fight like hell to get those things.
You all right, Karev?
Meredith messed with the Alzheimer's trial.
Anything else feels ... Like death.I'd have my work, my friends.
But someone in your life all the time?
More trouble than it's worth.
Okay. Crib goes here.
Apparently, I got over it.
Changing table will go ... right here.
♪ Easy to find, you see ♪
But you can't plan a baby room before you have a baby.
I mean, that ... you're gonna jinx the adoption.
No, the social worker wants to see where we live.
This is like a death trap.
I'm trying to create a reasonable distraction. - Oh.
Hello. Janet, welcome.
How are you? Thanks for coming out.
Oh, be careful. Watch those nails.
♪ She leaves them there ♪
♪ for you to find ♪
Perfect for a baby, right?
♪ You leave behind the weight of the future ♪
I'm gonna stop in the lab.
I'll see you after the intake, okay?
Okay. Oh, God. I forgot it was the Hobarts today.
It always bums me out when we have an Alzheimer's patient with young kids. Well, there's no shame in sitting this one out.
I can do the intake. Stop treating me like I'm your wife.
On the trial, I'm a colleague.
I'm allowed to say it bums me out.
Doesn't mean you have to feed me warm milk and run a bath.
Treat me like a doctor. Right.
Sorry. Okay. Go do the intake, colleague.
Shepherd, you got a minute?
I need to talk to you about your trial.
Oh, um ... well, I should get Meredith.
I just got a lecture on the failure to extend professional courtesy to one's spouse.
I think it's best you don't get Meredith.
You're in ... in very good hands.
I still feel bad that I'm not gonna be here.
For the surgery? I'll be unconscious.
That's not when I'm gonna miss you.
Okay. Then I guess I w ... You can feel bad about all the time that follows.
You know, when I'm not under general anesthesia, and you're still not here.
You're halfway around the world ... With Arnold.
Andrew. Raah!
Excuse me? He's a rock star.
I kind of feel like the sound of an adoring crowd should follow his name.
I don't ... I don't ... Is that a compliment or an insult? I don't know. I guess it depends on how you feel about rock stars.
Okay, well, Andrew is not a rock st ... Raah! - Okay, you know what? Can you stop that, please?
It's starting to get annoying.
My wife's leaving. I'm allowed to be annoying.
I'm not a real wife, so that doesn't buy for a lot of bad behavior.
Well, you're my real best friend. What does that get me?
I'm sorry.
Don't be. Go be happy ... with Andrew. Raah!
You're impossible.
Yeah, you, too.
Meredith, tell me exactly what you did.
I can't tell you.
We can still fix this, but I need to know what you did.
If I tell you, it'll make it worse.
It's worse already. Meredith ... Listen, I-I ... I love you.
And I'm sorry.
But I can't tell you anything.
You wanted to be treated like a colleague?
I'm gonna treat you like a colleague.
Alex Karev informed Dr. Hunt that Dr. Grey tampered with my clinical trial.
She switched around the placebos and the drugs, probably invalidating ... my trial.
Is this true?
Nothing I did has any effect ... Tell me exactly what happened.
I can't do that. Do you have any idea what you've done?
You think the F. D. A. will get anywhere near this hospital ever again?
Meredith, look at me.
If this is wrong, if there is something going on, if Karev is exaggerating, this is the part where you have to tell me.
This is the part where you have to deny the charges.
Kick me off the study.
There's nothing wrong with the study.
Nothing I did changes anything.
But you're not denying it?
I'm gonna have to investigate what's going on here, but it looks to me like you just lost your job.
So they're probably gonna fire me.
Are you happy? Oh, come on. They're not gonna ... I want your crap out of my house by the end of the day.
What the hell was that?
A 757 went down in the sound.
We're looking at about
200 injured passengers.
We're the designated crisis center.
Families will be instructed to come here to find their loved ones.
We are activating surge protocol.
Dr. Hunt is gonna be running the show.
It's gonna be chaotic. You need to listen carefully.
You need to stay focused. Do not contribute to the panic.
Now get to your stations.
Dr. Bailey, let's clear any beds that we can.
Discharge or transfer. Okay, uh, Grey.
All right, Torres, you'll be with me.
Kepner, set up the E. R. for triage.
Other Grey, I want you running the family center.
Take over in the cafeteria. Yang, blood bank.
Uh, we might need a Candyman. Dr. Sloan will be our Candyman.
Let's be liberal with pain meds for our victims and sedatives for patients that we are moving.
Uh, Avery, you can help him out. Let's move, people.
What happened with Meredith? Cristina, I can't ... Owen. She tampered with Shepherd's study.
Invalidated the results. She destroyed the whole thing.
There was a plane crash. They're gonna cancel your procedure and try to send you home.
You need to tell them that you are a D-1.
You don't need to be in pre-op, but that you want to be moved to a regular room.
That way, when the hospital starts doing surgery again, you'll be first in the queue. Don't you have a plane ... Wait. Did they shut down the airport?
No, but we're not leaving till it's over.
They need surgeons and trauma counselors.
These are your films. They're gonna schedule your surgery at Seattle Presbyterian.
Seattle Pres can't take anymore. Start calling County. Avery!
Why'd you give me that guy in the middle of a mass trauma?
Avery? The kid quit Webber's study. What kind of idiot decides working with the chief of surgery is too taxing on his schedule?
He didn't quit because he thinks it's too much hard work.
He quit because he thinks the chief has a shot at a Harper Avery, and he was worried that if his name was on it, it would kill Webber's chances.
Kepner, discharges. Yeah.
You know, she's the only one who ever gave a rat's ass about you, and now you might have destroyed her career.
You should find some skanky intern to love you, 'cause next time you're in a burning building, no one is handing you a glass of water.
Please make sure you give us a cell phone number ... Matthew Ruiz? Do you have ... No one from the flight has arrived yet.
As soon as we get any infor ... Do you have a list of people they're bringing to the hospital? Because we ... Folks, it can take emergency services quite a long time to move and identify people in a situation like this.
Please just try to be patient ... Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Look, my wife was on the plane.
Can you please just tell me ... Sir, at this point, we don't have any information.
Please just sign the sheets.
I'd like to speak to your supervisor.
Somebody that knows what's going on.
Ma'am, my supervisor doesn't have any information.
Nobody has any information. Please just sign the sheet.
Dr. Hunt, I had way too many drinks before I told you that.
I-I didn't mean for ... Not now, Karev.
Look, I told you that because
I didn't think she should be chief resident, not that she should be fired. If you didn't think this through, then you are as dumb as she is.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Uh ... the plane was from Baltimore, where my parents live.
I've taken that flight, um ... with my son.
You want to come sit down with me for a minute?
No, no, no. I can't, uh ... There's too much, uh ... Okay. Um ... I'm just gonna ... I'm just gonna stand here for a minute.
Is that all right?
Are you on any medications? No.
Ever given blood before?
Nope.
Any chance you're pregnant?
Mm ... I don't know.
When was your last period? Not sure.
Uh, what were you doing, um, last time you had to deal with tampons?
Like maybe it was St. Patrick's Day, and you ate, uh, four green doughnuts and thought, wow, that's disgusting.
I must be hormonal. Oh, my gosh!
You're right! Except it was these gross cookies with green frosting.
But that was a while ago.
Uh, I guess I had mine again around Easter ... 'Cause I was all over the marshmallow peeps.
It totally works.
Hey. W-what the hell?
It looks about 6 weeks to me.
I take it this wasn't deliberate.
No.
Okay.
You want to talk about options?
No.
Officials say it's too early to speculate on the cause of the crash.
But here's what we do know ... The flight originated this morning in Baltimore carrying 183 passengers and 18 crew members ... Still nobody? Oh, their families are going crazy.
What is taking so long?
Well, fishing 200 people out of the water is slow business.
You want to play "Angry Birds"?
They'll do triage at the waterfront.
It takes time. Actually, if they're taking this long, there's gonna be a lot of hypothermia. Kepner. Oh, yeah.
Warm blankets, heated lamps, and heated I. V. fluids. - Got it.
You post chief resident yet? Uh, no. Not yet.
What's the holdup?
The suspense ain't killing me. It's gonna be Grey.
Well, I thought Karev made a great play for it.
A plane full of orphans ... That's pretty impressive. Ah, he's already decided.
You don't have to lobby for your boy. Karev.
I want a written account of exactly what you saw, every detail ... when, where ... Oh, look, sir, I-I don't think that's ... I-I don't want to know what you think. Okay?
Need more sedatives.
The people we're transferring are starting to freak out.
♪ When I was lost and looking down ♪
♪ and turned it all ♪
You're a good man, Avery.
♪ With your light ♪
Lexie's yours.
Take her. Take care of her.
I'll stay out of your way.
I kind of already have her, but ... Thank you?
You're welcome.
I need to talk to you.
You know, I think I'm gonna order pizza.
If you want, I can get ... I'm pregnant.
Cristina ... I cannot believe this is happening.
I know. I know it's complicated.
I know it wasn't supposed to happen like this, but ... Cristina, this could be something ... What? No.
There's no way we're doing this. Do you hear me? Cristina ... No, no. I-I am not this uh, uh, beautiful vessel for all that might be good about the future.
I'm not carrying your hopes and dreams. No. I get to talk.
I'm here. There's two of us. We are a partnership.
Can we just ... just think together? Is that okay?
I know who you are. I know what you want.
I love you.
I don't love the incubating potential of your womb.
I love you.
Why would I want to do something that would make you miserable?
Do you think I love you more when you're miserable?
Do you think I-I-I want that, you running off to Meredith?
You think I'm looking for more of that?
But ... I think there's a way ... No, no! I-I still get to talk.
There is a way to make this work without it ruining your life or derailing your career.
I don't want a baby.
Well, you have one.
Are ... Are you getting all life-y on me?
How late are you?
That does not matter.
Of course it matters.
Okay, fine. You tell me when life begins.
You know, I can't ... I can't wait to hear this one.
I don't know. Does it ... does it have hands?
I cannot believe you are doing this.
I'm just asking a question.
I don't want one.
I don't hate children. I respect children.
I think they should have parents who want them.
I want them.
I want them, and maybe you could to.
I believe ... Your life can be bigger than you think it is.
I know you can contain more than you think you can.
I'm not saying we do this. I am just saying, let's think.
Let's see what kind of life we can imagine.
Cristina Yang ... I imagine such a huge life for us.
This is an extremely serious accusation, Meredith.
Can't you tell me anything?
I-I-I-I can't. I-I'm sorry.
Talk to me.
How many patients are we talking about here?
Did this happen more than once?
I can't say that either.
She can't say anything.
We're gonna unwind this, Meredith.
Karev is figuring out what cases he was on when he saw you, he'll narrow down the dates, we'll know which patients ... Nothing I did changed the trial.
Uh, fire me. Do whatever you have to do.
Look, you don't get to choose, okay?
You don't get to decide who gets the drug or the placebo.
You don't get to decide what information the trial gets.
Anything I tell you affects the trial.
If you don't know what I did, the trial stays blind.
The trial is over. You screwed me.
You screwed this hospital. And you screwed yourself.
This is your disease we're trying to cure.
Or Lou Gehrig's disease, but I did this for you.
Derek, it was Adele.
Uh, maybe I should put some I. V. fluids in the heater warm them up? - No.
But if people have been in the water for that long ... April ... But if we just ... No one's coming.
If it's taking this long, nobody survived.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Well, the protocol is fairly clear.
Are you encouraging him to fire me?
Look, Derek, I basically pressured her to do it. - Mm.
You'd have to fire us both.
I'm gonna have to suspend you so it doesn't look so bad.
The study ... I need to turn the whole mess over to the F. D. A. , let them figure out what to do with it.
I mean, I-I can't. I just ... Meredith ... I don't know how to ... I know.
Emergency services has begun identifying bodies.
They've given us a list.
The airline reps are on their way.
We've got social workers here and more coming.
It's a long list. Each of you have families to inform.
So, uh, please be outside the cafeteria in exactly one hour.
You'll call one family at a time.
And you'll be assigned a room to take them to and deliver the news.
It's gonna be a-a long day.
That's it.
Dr. Hunt, you gave chief resident to Kepner?
It was supposed to be me or Grey.
Do you think anyone's gonna listen to Kepner?
It's gonna be complete chaos.
You think anyone's gonna listen to you?
You just sold out the one universally liked individual at this hospital. Everyone is gonna hate you.
A chief resident's supposed to manage their peers, be a resource and a support. After what you did, do you think anyone is gonna come to you for anything?
I was planning to give it to you.
And now?
So it's possible that we'll never ... That we just ... We just won't get the treatment?
It's a possibility, yes.
Oh, my God. This isn't right.
We're so close.
He needs this. Can you just ... Is it killing people?
No. So give it to him anyway.
I wish we could. No. Don't give me that.
You can and you're choosing not to. Audrey ... No. They say there's nothing they can do.
There's a drug in a box in this hospital, and you were on the schedule.
My children's father is disappearing.
Give him the damn drug!
I could take a leave for six months or a year.
No, you couldn't.
Yes, I ... Sure, I could. They're not gonna fire me. No.
Stop saying no. I'm telling you, I want this.
I can do this.
This does not have to be your problem.
It'll be my problem. You wouldn't even ... What, notice? It'll be a baby.
I'm not a monster. If I have a baby, I'll ... I'll love it.
That's the problem.
That you'll love it.
That ... that's a problem that we can work with.
I'm sorry. Are you laughing right now?
No, no. I'm just ... I'm not ... I just ... I love you.
What is so ... Are you even listening to me?
Yes. I'm just trying to figure out some kind of a compromise.
Okay, but you know what? There is no compromise.
You don't have half a baby.
I don't want one.
Okay, I-it isn't about work.
This isn't a scheduling conflict.
I don't want to be a mother.
Cristina, do you love me?
Of course I do.
Do you trust me?
I ... y-yes.
You'd be a great mother. You would.
I-I know you don't believe me, but it is true.
Just sit with this for a little while, this terrible idea that you might love a baby.
Just for me, sit with it ... Did you even hear ... I mean, okay. Why would I do that?
Because you love me. You love me.
That's why.
I have three names.
I don't think I can do this three times.
One foot in front of the other.
Oh, I've got something that'll cheer you up.
Sloan gave us his blessing.
Well, that's not really right.
More like he gave you to me, which was nice.
Are you serious?
Yep. Though I probably owe him a goat.
Okay.
All right. Let's do it.
Is the Schoman family here ... Jessica and Maxwell?
Jason Schoman. He's our son.
I'm Dr. Altman. Will you follow me, please?
They think it's good news.
Elaine Chen.
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Sloan. Why don't you come with me?
Uh, Gilda and Miguel Ruiz?
This is a nightmare.
Hi, I'm Dr. Bailey. Come with me, please.
I brought some pudding.
That's why you're here?
I've got a good nurse. She'll hook me up with pudding.
I know. It's just ... Oh, I just spent the last two hours telling people that their family members were dead, and I needed to ... Well, I just wanted to say hi ... Or bye again.
I don't know. I ... I really tried to be a gentleman about all this.
But now you need to get the hell out. What are you doing?
Letting you go was the worst thing I've ever done.
It was the most painful thing I've ever done, and I'm a guy who has had 82 surgeries.
My threshold for pain is pretty high.
You need to get out.
I'm not your best bud. I'm not your security blanket.
I'm a man who's in love with you, who waltzed you into the arms of a damn knight on a horse.
So go to Germany and have little spaetzle-eating children.
And please, for God sakes, leave me alone.
The cafeteria is pandemonium.
There.
Are you admitting anyone?
No, we're signing in a few so we can give 'em sedatives.
That's about it.
E. R.
There's a survivor.
Are you leaving? No, I didn't get fired.
I know that's disappointing to you.
My trial is about to disappear.
You really want to act like I'm the bad guy here?
No, I don't. I know the fact that it is Adele changes things for Richard, but it doesn't for me. Oh, I understand that.
You couldn't possibly understand that.
If you were focused on the millions of people with Alzheimer's whose lives could've been different, would've been better because of this drug, there's no way in hell you would've pulled this stunt.
How is it that you don't know the difference between right and wrong?
Because I don't think that things are simply right or wrong.
Things are more complicated than that.
This was more complicated than that.
It's complicated that it was Adele and Richard.
It's complicated that we have a drug in a box that could help her.
There's nothing simple about that.
I am very sorry that I
messed everything up.
But I would do it again.
I don't know how to raise a child with someone who doesn't understand that there's a ... a right and a wrong in the world.
So now I'm gonna be a bad mother.
That's where we're going with this?
You've been saying it for weeks.
Maybe you're right.
Okay.
Maybe you're right.
I just need some time to think.
I just ... I just need some space.
***
Sarah Gordon ... G. C. S. of 6, head injury and multiple contusions to mid-torso.
Systolic 70s in the field. Unaccompanied minor?
Yeah, she was flying alone. On my count.
One, two, three. Okay, I need X-ray in here.
We need to shoot a C-spine, chest, and pelvis. Abdomen's rigid.
I've got the ultrasound.
Large hematoma on the left temporal lobe.
Breath sounds are equal. Folks, we've got eyes.
Let me get in there. Sarah, I'm Dr. Shepherd.
You see all these people around you?
They're doctors.
You ever seen this many doctors before?
Hey, don't worry. We're all here to take care of you, okay?
Hey, honey.
They found his body.
Because his wallet was still in his pocket.
They said because the impact.
I don't know.
Maybe it was fast.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
There's no battery.
I'm pushing the button. I don't hear anything.
Honey, let me try, okay?
The battery is dead. What are you gonna try?
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Ma'am. Can I help you?
We have to call someone ... But the cell phone's not working.
Okay, well, we have phones that you can use. Uh, Jenny.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
Why don't you take a seat?
Excuse me. Is the Gordon family here?
The Gordons?
They found somebody?
A little girl. Unaccompanied minor.
They're operating on her right now.
Thank you. Yeah.
We should go home, honey.
A little girl made it. She's alive.
I think we should stay.
She doesn't have anyone. Her parents aren't here yet.
I think we should stay. Gilda ... If Matthew had been ... I would like ... to stay.
Okay.
Okay.
We'll stay.
I'll, uh ... I will let you know how she's doing.
Mer.
Oh, the adoption lady's paging me. Derek's A. W. O. L.
He's not even speaking to me.
Wait a minute. Is it a true? What ... what were you thinking?
I was thinking that the chief's wife was about to have saline injected in her brain instead of a drug that could stop her from being a gorked-out lump. Derek's head almost exploded.
Are they gonna fire you? I'm suspended.
The chief backed way off when he found out it was Adele.
I did what I had to do. Meredith ... And I couldn't live with myself if I'd done anything different.
And Karev is trying to ruin my life.
Mer.
What did you say to her? I didn't say anything.
Janet, anything he says ... Can you just shut up for one second?
This isn't about that.
We're granting you temporary custody of Zola, pending the completion of the petition, at which point, assuming all goes well, you'll be granted permanent custody.
And her doctor here says she's doing great, so you can take her home ... Today.
Her incisions look fine. She's tolerating a normal diet.
She'll need neuro follow-ups. She's still on antibiotics.
Uh, here's a prescription for any pain meds she might need, but she's been fine the last couple of days.
Do you have any questions about anything?
Meredith, do you have any questions?
Oh, hi. You done?
Uh, no, no.
I still have some more, uh, families.
Uh, sorry I paged you. I just wanted to see your face.
I think, you know, something like this happens, you just ... You want to be with someone that you love.
So we're booked on a 9:00 A. M. flight tomorrow.
Let's just spend the night in some fancy hotel, just never get out of the bath.
What? Are you okay?
Derek, I understand that you don't want to talk to me, but this is important.
I need to talk to you.
I'm your wife. You need to call me back.
Does anyone know where there's a nurse or an information person?
She should be right back.
My daughter was in the crash.
They said she had to have surgery. Are we supposed to ... You're Mrs. Gordon? Yes. Sarah Gordon is my d ... They're still operating.
The doctors have been here every half-hour.
They'll be here any minute. Say, would you like some coffee or ... I'll get it. I'll get it.
Here, sit down. You must have been driving like crazy.
I ... I don't under ... Are you ... We heard she was alone.
I thought, as a parent, if my child was here alone, I ... Well, we all thought that she should have someone pulling for her.
Thank you.
That's incredible.
Diapers and swaddle blankets ... And formula.
These little bottles are good for the diaper bag.
You have a diaper bag?
No. - Oh, we'll get you one. We've got a few in the NICU closet.
You know, we have all this gear ... The parents come in, the baby doesn't make it, they ... they don't want to see the stuff, so they just leave it behind.
Now here's the pacifiers. She likes the green ones.
Is your husband putting the car seat in the car?
Don't have a car seat. Not even sure I have a husband.
Surgeons, right?
You probably forget what he looks like without a mask.
We'll get you one.
You're probably gonna need a porta-crib, too.
I'm gonna throw in some more diaper cream.
She went with her dad to visit her grandparents, and he had to stay so he put her on the plane, and ... there was a flight attendant that watched her and was supposed to walk her to her connecting flight in Vancouver.
We never imagined ... God, I'm sorry.
I never even asked. You had someone on the plane.
My son ... Matthew.
Oh, i-is he in surgery, too?
Yes.
Will he be okay?
Yes, he will.
Sarah's out of surgery. You can come see her now.
Hey.
Can you stand up?
I thought I was pretty clear, Teddy.
Just shut up and stand up. I-I have to do something, and I can't do it while you're lying in a hospital bed.
I don't want a good-bye hug. It's gonna make you feel better.
It's not gonna make me feel a ... Can you just stand up?
You're my husband, and ... And I think I'm falling in love with you.
Hey, how you doing?
Ugh. Not now, Mark.
Oh, come on, Lexie. You've been in the dead zone all day ... You have to stop.
You gotta stop talking to me and checking on me and talking to my boyfriend.
I love you, and I am always gonna love you.
But I don't want to love you.
I want to be happy, and Jackson makes me happy.
And if you keep pulling at me, I'm ... I'll come back to you.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
You got what you wanted. You wanted a family.
So please just let me have what I want.
I said you were right.
I told Avery I was letting you go.
Did he tell you that part? Yeah. It's paternalistic and weird.
I'm letting you go, Lexie.
That means you gotta ... walk away.
Chief friggin' resident. Unbelievable.
I'm sorry.
What? Don't be. You deserve it.
I'm happy.
Hi. Can you take that for me? Thanks.
I have what I want. It's been such a crappy year.
I can't believe we're both happy.
I can't believe they like me enough to make me chief resident. They hated me for so long.
I can't believe I actually have friends here.
Well, they're gonna hate you again.
It's now your job to boss them around.
You know how much they love that.
Oh, God. Is that true?
That's true.
Okay, so this is the house.
There's another house where you're gonna have your own room, but that, right now, is just wood and no walls, so we're gonna stay here for a while.
Derek?
Okay. He might be A. W. O. L. He's had a bad day.
And he's a little ... pissed off right now.
But we're gonna be fine.
So we had a big plan if this ever worked out.
We were gonna have a lullaby from Malawi to make everything feel homey for you.
To be honest, right now, I can't even think of an American lullaby.
Lexie.
You know, a lot of people live here.
It gets kind of crazy sometimes, and it's usually not this quiet.
Alex.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
You and I, we're a team, right?
We're tough. We have that in common.
I am very glad you're here.
I didn't think your first day was gonna be quite like this.
But I am gonna get it together, and we are gonna figure it out.
Tell me how much you love me.
I ... I love you a very great deal.
A lot?
You love me so much.
I want you to remember that.
I made an appointment to terminate the pregnancy.
I'm sorry if this upsets you.
I'm sorry if this isn't what you wanted.
But ... I cannot talk about it anymore.
I ... need to lie down. I feel like crap.
This is a marriage.
I tied my life to you.
You don't decide this without me.
Do you see me standing here? My head is killing me.
You give in a marriage. You make sacrifices.
I've made many, and I am asking you to do something for me.
Can you simply consider doing something for me?
Have a baby? This isn't pizza versus thai.
You don't give a little on a baby. Cristina, I am asking you ... I am saying no!
Get out.
Are you ... Because I'm denying you a baby, you're trying ... Because you denied me part of the decision, because you denied me a marriage.
Oh, how dare you ... Get out!
Um, I'm gonna go.
I just wanted to s-say good night.
I want to come home with you.
Oh, no. I can't. Um, Tuck's with me tonight.
I can meet your son.
I'm not gonna bite your son.
No, it's ... it's just not the right time.
Uh-huh. I-I can't ... This is a relationship. Things today were bad.
We lean on each other when things are bad.
That information's not gonna hurt your child, and if it does, then this is not the right relationship for me.
Okay.
I can control myself in your house.
I'm not gonna touch you. Okay.
You just ... you know, you could tell him I'm your friend.
Tell him whatever you need to ... Okay.
Oh. I was hoping you were Derek.
Sorry. Well, he took off, and the hospital gave me a baby.
She's upstairs sleeping in some dead kid's porta-crib.
Uh, I'm getting an abortion ... And Owen just kicked me out of my house.
What? You're ... Pregnant.
And you're ... Getting an abortion.
Well ... why didn't you tell me?
You had a busy, busy day.
There's a reason I said I'd be happy alone.
Come upstairs. I need help.
I ... I can't.
I gotta lie down.
It wasn't 'cause I thought I'd be happy alone.
It was because I thought if I loved someone ... And then it fell apart ... I might not make it.
Tell me not to go to Africa.
Alex.
Go to hell.
It's easier to be alone.
Because what if you learn that you need love ... And then you don't have it?
What if you like it and lean on it?
What if you shape your life around it ... And then ... It falls apart?
Can you even survive that kind of pain?
Losing love is like organ damage.
It's like dying.
The only difference is ... Death ends.
This?
It could go on forever.
